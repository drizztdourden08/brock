The input and display modules run on Android. Each ships a Capacitor plugin in its package: `BrockInput` drives SDL3 inside the app through a JNI library built against the same pinned SDL3 source as the desktop addon, and takes controller keys before the WebView without any change to `MainActivity`; `BrockDisplay` reads the display's rates and asks Android for a synced one through the window's preferred refresh rate. `inputApi()`, `displayApi()` and `window.api.input` and `window.api.display` return the same API on Android as on the desktop, so app code does not branch; raw and joystick capture, the bundled mapping database and window modes stay desktop only (the module READMEs list each limit). `platform add android` and `mobile build` wire the modules in `modules` into the Gradle project, a built-in module left out of `modules` stays out through `android.includePlugins`, and `doctor android` asks for the NDK and CMake the input module builds with. brock-core adds `nativePlugin` and `listenNative`, brock-react adds `exposeHostNamespace`.

Main has a place for app services: `bootstrapApp(product, { services: (ctx) => createAppServices(ctx) })` builds them once, at the start of the modules boot task (after the paths, before the handlers), exposes them as `ctx.services`, typed through the new `AppServices` augmentation, and calls their `dispose()` on will-quit. Reading `ctx.services` before the build, or without the option, throws and says which. The `app-services` migration turns a WeakMap memo keyed by `MainContext` into a to-do.

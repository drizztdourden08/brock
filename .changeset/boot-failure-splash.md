A renderer boot task that fails while the window shows now draws Tessera's `Splash`, the same as the boot splash page: the app name and mark, `<task> failed` with the error under it, a danger bar, the version, and Retry, Open logs (the logs folder) and Quit. It covers the window, and the app root is inert under it. The splash page draws its mark in `ts-mark` and the error in `ts-detail`, and the splash plugin puts the app look on the app page, so both splashes share the gradient.

A bug report transport can keep the dialog open after a report went out. `afterSend: 'view'` beside `contact` and `attachments` (in `BrockApp`'s `bugReport` or in `bootstrapApp`'s) shows the receipt in the dialog in place of the form: the message, the report id, Open when the receipt has a `url`, and Close. The default, `'toast'`, closes the dialog and raises the toast as before; the GitHub issue and the clipboard always toast.

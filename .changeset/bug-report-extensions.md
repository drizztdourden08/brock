Five additions to the bug report. `bugReport.open({ title })` and `bugReport.setDefaultTitle(title)` prefill the title, cleared when the dialog closes. `section` in `BrockApp`'s `bugReport` is a component the dialog renders below the attachments; it gets `setExtras` and `disabled`, and what it sets joins the payload's `extras`. `transport` is now optional there, so an app with a main transport can still add a section. `identity` beside a transport (a string in `BrockApp`, `identity(ctx)` in `bootstrapApp`, reported as `BugReportTransportInfo.identity`) shows "Reporting as <identity>" in place of the contact field. A receipt's `links`, `{ label, url }[]`, each get a button in the receipt view, with the single `url` still shown as Open. A receipt's `retry` shows Retry upload in the receipt view, even for a toast transport; a main transport's `retry` stays in main and runs over the new `bugReport:retry` channel, the renderer getting a `retryId` in `BugReportReceiptWire`. The review checks the prefilled title.

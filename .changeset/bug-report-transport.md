The bug report hands its payload to an app transport. Brock keeps the dialog and builds `BugReportPayload` (title, description, app id, name and version, and when attached the debug text, the host facts and the last 200 redacted log lines). An app passes `transport(payload) => Promise<Result<BugReportReceipt>>` as `<BrockApp bugReport={{ transport, label? }} />`, or in main as `bootstrapApp(product, { bugReport: { transport(payload, ctx), label? } })` over the new `bugReport:transport` and `bugReport:send` channels; with neither, the GitHub issue on `product.repo` stays the default and the clipboard the last resort. The send button carries the transport's label and spins while it runs; a receipt's message and link show in the toast, and a failure keeps the dialog open with the error so the user can try again. `writeDebugZip` and `collectDebugFiles` in brock-electron give a main transport the debug zip: the payload, the logs of `Data/debug` and the app's own entries. `useDebugText` also returns `system`.

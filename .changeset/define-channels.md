An IPC channel is declared once: `defineChannels({ engineStatus: invoke<() => Promise<EngineStatus>>()('ap:engine:status'), onProgress: event<(p: number) => void>()('ap:engine:progress') })` from brock-core gives the preload maps (`maps.invoke`, `maps.send`, `maps.events`), the augmentation types (`InvokeContractOf`, `SendContractOf`, `EventContractOf`) and typed entries: main's `handle`, `on` and `emit` take an entry in place of the channel name, and brock-react's `channelApi(APP_CHANNELS)` types the renderer calls by method name. Channels written in the augmentation, a map and a handler keep working. The new app declares its channels this way, knip treats `src/ipc/contract.type.ts` as an entry, and the `channel-declarations` migration lists, as one to-do, every channel an app could move. docs/ipc.md shows both styles.

Three main-side hooks for app data and sound. `bootstrapApp({ fileGuard })` is asked before each write of the base `file:*` handlers (`writeBytes`, `writeText`, `remove`, `mkdir`, `trash`) with `{ kind, path }`, and refuses the write when it answers `false` or a reason. `FileStore.trash(path)` moves a file or folder under `Data/` to the system trash, in main (`ctx.files.trash`) and from the renderer (`file:trash`, the Electron `files` port). `window:setAudioMuted` and `window:isAudioMuted` mute the app window and read it back, also as the window port's optional `setAudioMuted` and `isAudioMuted`.

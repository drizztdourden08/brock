New job options for `ctx.job` and `jobs.start`:

- `visible: false` runs a quiet job. It reports progress like any other job and its snapshot carries `visible: false`, but it stays out of the title bar item and the job dialog. It clears itself 30 s after it ends, whether it succeeded, failed or was cancelled. Every `JobSnapshot` now has `visible`.
- `forwardLog: true` also writes the job's log lines to the app log as `[job <id>] <message>`. A main job writes through `ctx.log`, a renderer job to the `app` channel. The app log keeps the lines after the job is gone.
- `onDuplicate` sets what starting an id that is still running does. `'throw'` is the default and keeps today's "already running" error. `'queue'` starts the new job under the same id once the running one ends. `'parallel'` starts it under the first free `<id>-2`, `<id>-3` and so on. `'join'` returns a handle on the running job, whose `run` resolves with that job's result instead of running the work again.

`JobHandle` gains `started` (resolves once the job runs) and `ended` (resolves with `done`, `failed` or `cancelled`), so a hand-written `JobHandle` fake needs both. `createJobRegistry(emit, now?, sink?)` takes a sink for the forwarded log lines. `useJob(id)` also returns `step`, the current step with its label, beside `job`, which is `null` when no such job is known. It follows main and renderer jobs alike, so a page can show a job's progress inline.

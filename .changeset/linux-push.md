`<app> linux push` builds the Linux AppImage in a VirtualBox VM, or in WSL and copies it in, installs its desktop entry, pins it to the dock and launches it on the VM's desktop. `<app> linux doctor` checks the ssh client, VirtualBox, the VM and its state, key-only SSH access, the Guest Additions and the build tools, and `<app> linux init` writes this machine's `~/.brock/linux/<repo>.json` and prints the one-time VM steps. The machine file never holds a password: a password-like key stops the command and every ssh call runs with `BatchMode=yes`. `linux` in `brock.workspace.mjs` sets the app, the build command, the artifact folder, extra shared folders and the launch flags.

The app can now change the title bar menu Brock builds, entry by entry, while the detected menu stays the default. `product.menu.entries` in `brock.config.ts` and the same object in a screen's `meta.menu` take, per entry key, `inMenu: false` (out of the menu only, still reached by the search palette, its route and its shortcut), `hidden: true` (out of the menu, the search palette and the keyboard shortcuts, still openable from code by its route), `label`, `group` (`'main'`, `'sections'`, `'modules'` or `'end'`), `order` (like CSS `order`, 0 by default), `before` and `after` another entry's key, and `parent` (a submenu's key, or `null` for the top level). They merge in that order, the app config last. Every built-in entry, section, bucket, page, card and module entry has a stable key; docs/app-structure.md lists them. The View sub-menu takes only a label, since the title bar draws it.

`brock check` reports a field it does not know, a wrong value, a `bucket:` or `screen:` key no screen file gives, an entry that names itself and a `before` and `after` loop; a development launch logs the rest once each, such as a key no entry has or a parent that is not a submenu. Nothing throws: an override that cannot apply is skipped.

With no active profile, every menu entry that opens a screen needing a profile now shows as disabled with the reason, Pick or create a profile first, as Home already did, instead of looking enabled and opening nothing.

The review's menu checks follow the effective menu: the built-in entries and the last group are read where the overrides put them, a hidden screen is no longer expected in the menu, each overridden entry gets a `menu-entry-<key>` check that it is out of the menu, or drawn at its place between its neighbours, and each hidden entry a `search-hidden-<key>` check that the palette does not list it.

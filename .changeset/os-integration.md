OS integration in the product config. `product.protocols` declares deep link schemes (`relic-of-the-past://install/abc`), `product.fileAssociations` gains a default mime type and a shipped Windows icon, and a `product.schemes` entry with `dir` is served from `Data/<dir>` through `protocol.handle` (`app-sprite://` over `Data/sprites`). `defineProduct` checks all three lists.

The installer registers them: on Windows the updater's Velopack hooks write and remove the `HKCU\Software\Classes` keys, and the installer stub runs `--os-integration=register` after a portable install; on macOS electron-builder writes Info.plist; on Linux the deb's `.desktop` file and mime XML come from electron-builder, the managed post-install refreshes both databases, and an AppImage writes its own entry under `~/.local/share`.

The running app receives each link or file from argv at launch, from a second launch through the single-instance lock (taken when the product declares a protocol or a file type, never for a named instance or an automation launch; `bootstrapApp({ singleInstance })` overrides it) and from macOS `open-url` and `open-file`. After the reveal, main hands each `OpenRequest` to `ctx.onOpen` and `bootstrapApp({ onOpen })`, and the renderer gets it through `useAppOpen` or `appOpen.on` (`app:takeOpens`, then `app:open`).

Sub-pages: `<page>/<sub>.sub.tsx` beside a page is a route under it (`meta.path`, such as `':id/edit'`), drawn in the page frame with "Back to <page>" before its title. It goes into the history, Escape and Back go up to the page, search finds the ones without params, and a page opens one with `openSub(id, params)`. `useUnsavedChanges(dirty)` asks "Discard changes?" before any navigation leaves a dirty page and adds its message to the quit confirm.

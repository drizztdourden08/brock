`--screenshot` waits until the app is ready to be pictured, and pictures the current frame. The renderer takes a hold with `holdScreenshot()` (or `useScreenshotHold(holding)`) while something it draws is not ready, such as a game view before its first frame; main waits for the reveal and then for every hold to be released, within the same 20 s watchdog. The capture now comes from the window's surface through the debugger (`Page.captureScreenshot`), since `capturePage` returned a stale frame for the headless window placed off every monitor; it falls back to `capturePage` when the debugger is taken.

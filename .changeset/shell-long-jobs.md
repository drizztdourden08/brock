Long jobs: `ctx.job(id, steps)` in main reports steps, weighted progress, the current line and log lines to the renderer and stops on cancel through its `signal`. `JobDialog` draws a job with Tessera's Stepper, ProgressBar and LogPanel, `useJob(id)` and `jobs.open(id)` drive it, and Hide moves a running job to a status tag in the title bar that reopens it.

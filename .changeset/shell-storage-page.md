File storage per data domain: `ctx.storage.domain(id)` in main and `dataDomain(id)` in the renderer read and write JSON, text and bytes, list, remove and size files, with every path kept inside the domain folder. A built-in `StoragePage`, added to a bucket as a page file, shows each domain's size with Open folder, Clear and "older than N days" clean rules (both confirmed), and exports chosen domains to a zip or a folder and imports them back. New template apps declare two domains and carry the page.

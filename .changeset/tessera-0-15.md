Brock takes Tessera 0.15.0 (peer range `^0.15.0`).

- Floating widgets resize from every edge and corner; `WidgetHost` passes `floatingMin` of 240 by 160, the least size of a widget window, so a floating widget and a popped one stop at the same size.
- The window guide sits beside the cursor in the window being moved or resized: main reads `screen.getCursorScreenPoint()` on every `will-move` and `will-resize`, turns it into that window's client pixels and sends it as `pointer` with the `widget:guide` state (`WindowGuideState.pointer`), and `WindowGuide` passes it to `WindowGuideOverlay`.
- `BrockApp.css` imports the brand palettes without `layer(ds.palette)`, since Tessera now puts them in that layer itself; an app's unlayered `theme.css` still wins.
- The search mascot clips are typed `MascotClip`. The widget options panel closes on its own and the widget body scrolls with a gutter, with no Brock code; Brock passes no window group prop.
- The review drags a floating widget's corner with real mouse events (`review:widgetProbe` takes `mouse`), checks the new size and the 240 by 160 floor, and checks the guide card beside the pointer the probe passes (`guide` takes `pointer`; the facts add `guideBeside`).

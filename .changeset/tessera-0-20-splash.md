The splash sits on Tessera's dark gradient, with text that holds WCAG AA. The splash page and the boot failure splash drop Brock's white radial highlight, the light drop shadow on the mark and the bright look under the text, so Tessera paints the palette's `--c-gradient-dark-from` to `--c-gradient-dark-to` under its tested text colours. Only an app with colours of its own (`product.look`, or palette seeds in its theme without its own `--p-gradient-dark-from` and `--p-gradient-dark-to`) gets `--look-dark-from` and `--look-dark-to`, from brock-core's new `darkPair`, which darkens its look toward black until the palette's `--c-text-dim` reads at 4.5:1 at both ends. `brock icons` writes `public/logos/mark.svg` from Tessera's `brand/dark-ground/<brand>.svg`, so both splashes show the mark in its dark ground colours. The installer and its Setup splash keep the bright look.

Brock takes Tessera 0.4.0: SectionNav is SideNav and HeaderTabs is HeaderAnchorNav (replayed with Brock's own Tessera renames step), the title bar menu, the fixed-head search results and the config loader are the published ones.

New apps' knip ignores `@drizztdourden08/standards`, whose stylelint plugins it sees through brock-lint-config; the `standards-lint-deps` upgrade step does the same for an existing app and drops `typescript-eslint` and `eslint-plugin-react-hooks`, which standards now carries.

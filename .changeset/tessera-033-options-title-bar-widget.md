Brock moves to Tessera ^0.33.0 (the catalog and the `brock-react` peer range, MIGRATION 224; RENAMES.json has no entry for 0.33.0, so an app changes nothing) and uses what it added for Brock. A settings choice's `disabled` (`true`, or a string that says why) now goes to Tessera's own `disabled` on the option, so a choice, select, radio or multi-choice with an option off draws its usual control with that option greyed, not pickable and skipped by the keys, and the reason as a pointer tooltip and an `aria-description`. Brock's `SettingChoiceField` stand-in is gone, and a radio with an option off stays a radio instead of turning into a select. On a host with the title bar and no window chrome, such as the Capacitor host, the title bar gets `controls={false}` and draws no window control at all, close included. A widget popped into its own window now shows the disabled state a docked one shows: the `widgetDisabled` hook's answer, through the dock's resolver, goes to Tessera's `Widget` as `disabled` (the message as the reason) with `onOpenSettings`, which asks main to bring the app window forward and open the setting there (`widget:openSetting`, `openWidgetSetting`; `widget:settingTarget`, `onWidgetSettingTarget`).

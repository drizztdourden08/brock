Every visual part of the shell is now a Tessera composite and Brock keeps only the wiring. The title bar is `WindowTitleBar`, the search palette is `CommandPalette` behind `PaletteHost`, About is `AboutPanel`, the profiles screen is `ProfilePicker` with `InlineCreateForm`, the screen rail is `SectionNav` in its rail variant, hubs and the settings hub sit in `NavLayout` with `SearchResults`, and settings pages are Tessera's `SettingsPage` with `SettingsGroupList`. The bug report button takes the `IconButton` danger tone, the diagnostics preview is a `CodeBlock`, the logs widget colours warnings and errors through `LogKindDef` tones, and the updater dialog uses `ReleaseNotesPanel` and `Callout`.

Removed exports: `TitleBar`, `WindowControls`, `InstanceBadge`, `About`, `ProfileCard`, `CreateProfileForm`, `ScreenRail`, `SettingsPage`, `SearchPalette` and `partitionByLock`; use the Tessera composites in their place. `useProfiles` gains `removeConfirmed`, which deletes without the confirm dialog. The search flash class is now `search-hit`.

Brock reads the app layout from `tessera.config.json`. The splash look, the splash token sheet and the installer take the app theme from `theme.css` of that file (with the app's `apps` entry merged in), through the app's own `@drizztdourden08/tessera/config`, and keep `src/theme.css` when there is no file or the installed Tessera has no config entry; a file that breaks the schema stops with an error naming it. `appThemeCss(rootDir)` is the new `@drizztdourden08/brock-build/theme` entry, and the managed `stylelint.config.mjs` takes its token file from it. A new app carries a root `tessera.config.json` with `$schema` alone. `brock adopt` writes one when it is missing: `$schema` alone for a single app, `package`, `parts` and one `apps` entry per app when the repo has `packages/design`.

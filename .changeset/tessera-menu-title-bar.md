Breaking: Brock moves to the next Tessera. The title bar menu is Tessera's hamburger `DropdownMenu`, built from `MenuGroup[]` by `toMenuGroups` in place of `toDropdownItems`, and a bucket or page `shortcut` shows beside its entry. `product.window.titleBar.controls` turns the fullscreen, pin, minimize and maximize buttons off; maximize and fullscreen off also make the main window not maximizable or fullscreenable. About shows the Tessera brand icon and wordmark when the product is that brand, the copy buttons write through `TesseraProvider` `overrides.writeText`, Hero facts take `FactsPanelGroup[]`, and the input module's device badges are `Status`. Migrations `progress-bar-tone` and `facts-panel-names` rewrite app code; `badge-status`, `tessera-provider-overrides`, `window-title-bar-config` and `dropdown-menu-groups` leave to-dos.

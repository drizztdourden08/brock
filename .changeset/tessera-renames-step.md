`brock migrate` replays Tessera's `RENAMES.json` after the Brock migrations: each release after `--tessera-from` (new), else `package.json#brock.tessera` (new pin), else 0.3.0, up to the installed Tessera, plus `next` when Tessera is linked to main; then it pins `brock.tessera` to the installed version. `brock migrate --tessera-from <version>` alone replays only the renames. Custom properties are renamed as whole tokens, components only where a file imports them from Tessera (the import, JSX tags and references), classes in class lists and selectors with a name boundary and longer keys first, props and prop values on the Tessera component's JSX, and literals typed with a renamed Tessera type. A value that is a note, a removed export, and a longer class built from a renamed one become numbered to-dos in the migration report; an entry whose value is also a key of its release is skipped with a warning, so a second replay changes nothing. `brock upgrade` passes the Tessera version the worktree had before its install as `--tessera-from` when the app has no pin yet.

Breaking: `RendererModule.titleBar` and `TitleBarSlot` are gone, and `STANDARD_TITLE_BAR_SLOTS` is now `STANDARD_TITLE_BAR_ACTIONS`. Tessera 0.8.0's `WindowTitleBar` takes `actions`, so a module lists `titleBarActions`: each a `WindowTitleBarAction` or a hook that returns one. Search (Ctrl+K) and Report a bug are standard actions, and the updater contributes `useUpdateAction`, a status pill reading "Update available" while an update waits. Every action is also in the hamburger, beside a View sub-menu with the pin and full screen, and an action replaces the menu entry of the same key there; Quit sits in its own group below them. The review checks the bar items, the menu actions and the View sub-menu. Migration `title-bar-actions` rewrites the updater badge and the standard buttons and leaves a to-do for any other slot.

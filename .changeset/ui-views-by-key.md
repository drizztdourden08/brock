`ui-views.json` is written by key. Brock read the file once and wrote its whole copy back on every change, so a key the app wrote to the same file in the meantime was lost. The renderer now sends only the keys it changed over the new `uiViews:patch` channel (`patchUiViews`), and main merges them into the file on disk, one write after another. An app keeps view state of its own there with `uiViews.read(key, fallback)`, `uiViews.write(key, value)` and `uiViews.remove(key)` from brock-react; the `profile:` keys stay Brock's.

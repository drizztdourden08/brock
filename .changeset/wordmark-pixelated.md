`product.icons.wordmark` takes `rendering`: `'auto'` (the default, smooth scaling) or `'pixelated'`, for pixel art that should scale with hard pixel edges. With `{ src: './logos/wordmark.png', rendering: 'pixelated' }`, About, the boot splash page, the window's failure splash and the Setup splash draw the wordmark with `image-rendering: pixelated` (nearest neighbour on the Setup splash); without it nothing changes, since most logos look wrong pixelated. `defineProduct` keeps `rendering: 'pixelated'` on the resolved wordmark and refuses any other value. `AboutPanel` takes `wordmarkRendering`.

### Patch Changes

- e769096: The splash sits on Tessera's dark gradient, with text that holds WCAG AA. The splash page and the boot failure splash drop Brock's white radial highlight, the light drop shadow on the mark and the bright look under the text, so Tessera paints the palette's `--c-gradient-dark-from` to `--c-gradient-dark-to` under its tested text colours. Only an app with colours of its own (`product.look`, or palette seeds in its theme without its own `--p-gradient-dark-from` and `--p-gradient-dark-to`) gets `--look-dark-from` and `--look-dark-to`, from brock-core's new `darkPair`, which darkens its look toward black until the palette's `--c-text-dim` reads at 4.5:1 at both ends. `brock icons` writes `public/logos/mark.svg` from Tessera's `brand/dark-ground/<brand>.svg`, so both splashes show the mark in its dark ground colours. The installer and its Setup splash keep the bright look.

## 0.22.0

### Patch Changes

- 73a287e: Importing a data area asks Merge (the default) or Replace in its confirm dialog (`confirmChoice`, a confirm dialog with a radio group). Merge keeps what is there and keeps the newer file when both have the same path; `storage:applyImport` takes the mode, the result counts the kept files (`kept`), and imported files keep the modified time they were exported with.

## 0.20.0

## 0.19.0

### Minor Changes

- df9c1df: Brock moves to Tessera 0.17.0: the workspace catalog and brock-react's peer range are `^0.17.0`. Small text is 12 px, and Field labels and DataTable headers are no longer forced to capitals (Archipelia review T-03). Two new settings control kinds: `path` (`pick`, `accept`, `placeholder`) draws Tessera's `PathField` on a string setting, with typing, a drop from the desktop and Browse, and `json` (`shape`) draws `JsonInput`, which saves the value only while the text parses. They come with new optional platform ports, `filePicker.pickPath`, `filePicker.pathOf` and `storage.revealLogs`, which the Electron host fills through the new `dialog:pickPath` and `debug:revealLogs` channels and the preload's `getFilePath`. `brock upgrade` writes `StatusOf` as `Status` from Tessera's `RENAMES.json`, and the `tessera-part-moves` migration moves `CopyButton`, `CopyValue` and their types from `/primitives` to `/composites`, and `ErrorBoundary` from `/composites` to `/primitives`.

## 0.18.0

## 0.17.1

## 0.17.0

### Minor Changes

- 3a35c8e: Main has a place for app services: `bootstrapApp(product, { services: (ctx) => createAppServices(ctx) })` builds them once, at the start of the modules boot task (after the paths, before the handlers), exposes them as `ctx.services`, typed through the new `AppServices` augmentation, and calls their `dispose()` on will-quit. Reading `ctx.services` before the build, or without the option, throws and says which. The `app-services` migration turns a WeakMap memo keyed by `MainContext` into a to-do.
- 3a35c8e: An IPC channel is declared once: `defineChannels({ engineStatus: invoke<() => Promise<EngineStatus>>()('ap:engine:status'), onProgress: event<(p: number) => void>()('ap:engine:progress') })` from brock-core gives the preload maps (`maps.invoke`, `maps.send`, `maps.events`), the augmentation types (`InvokeContractOf`, `SendContractOf`, `EventContractOf`) and typed entries: main's `handle`, `on` and `emit` take an entry in place of the channel name, and brock-react's `channelApi(APP_CHANNELS)` types the renderer calls by method name. Channels written in the augmentation, a map and a handler keep working. The new app declares its channels this way, knip treats `src/ipc/contract.type.ts` as an entry, and the `channel-declarations` migration lists, as one to-do, every channel an app could move. docs/ipc.md shows both styles.
- e70afc3: Long jobs: `ctx.job(id, steps)` in main reports steps, weighted progress, the current line and log lines to the renderer and stops on cancel through its `signal`. `JobDialog` draws a job with Tessera's Stepper, ProgressBar and LogPanel, `useJob(id)` and `jobs.open(id)` drive it, and Hide moves a running job to a status tag in the title bar that reopens it.
- e70afc3: File storage per data domain: `ctx.storage.domain(id)` in main and `dataDomain(id)` in the renderer read and write JSON, text and bytes, list, remove and size files, with every path kept inside the domain folder. A built-in `StoragePage`, added to a bucket as a page file, shows each domain's size with Open folder, Clear and "older than N days" clean rules (both confirmed), and exports chosen domains to a zip or a folder and imports them back. New template apps declare two domains and carry the page.

## 0.16.0

### Minor Changes

- 7ef6122: `hostApi<M>()` and `requireHostApi<M>()` take the app's own maps as a type argument (`{ invoke?, send?, events? }`, for example `typeof APP_INVOKE_MAP`) and add their methods to the base ones, so an app reaches its channels without a cast. Without one they return the base `IpcApi` as before. brock-core exports `AppIpcMaps` and `AppIpcApi`.
- 55befe4: The review watchdog starts in main at launch. When no tour progress (a capture or a check) arrives within 60 s, for example because the renderer failed to load, main writes a partial report with a failed `tour-started` check and exits 1, instead of waiting for minutes. Main also exits 5 s after the report when something holds the quit. brock-core exports `GLOBAL_STEP` from its review entry.

## 0.15.0

### Minor Changes

- 96f7759: The Performance widget is drawn with Tessera's chart parts.

  - A row of `StatTile`s for frame rate, CPU, memory and event loop lag, each with its change since the last sample and a `Sparkline` of the last 60 samples; `Gauge`s for the app's CPU, its share of system memory and the JS heap, sized to fit; a `StackedBar` of memory by process (main, renderer, GPU, utility, widget windows); an Activity list of long tasks, errors and warnings; and every reading in a collapsed Details section.
  - A container query puts two tiles a row when docked and four a row, with the gauges beside memory and activity, from 560 px. The widget no longer wraps itself in a `ScrollArea`; the widget body scrolls.
  - The refresh and sections options, Copy snapshot and sampling only while shown stay as they were.
  - `ProcessDiagnostics` adds `memoryTotalBytes`, and each `ProcessMetric` adds `window`, the Brock window a renderer process draws (`main` or a widget id).
  - The review checks that the tiles, sparklines, gauges and memory bar render and move, that the panel adds no scroll box of its own, and captures the widget docked and popped out narrow and wide.

- 96f7759: Brock takes Tessera 0.15.0 (peer range `^0.15.0`).

  - Floating widgets resize from every edge and corner; `WidgetHost` passes `floatingMin` of 240 by 160, the least size of a widget window, so a floating widget and a popped one stop at the same size.
  - The window guide sits beside the cursor in the window being moved or resized: main reads `screen.getCursorScreenPoint()` on every `will-move` and `will-resize`, turns it into that window's client pixels and sends it as `pointer` with the `widget:guide` state (`WindowGuideState.pointer`), and `WindowGuide` passes it to `WindowGuideOverlay`.
  - `BrockApp.css` imports the brand palettes without `layer(ds.palette)`, since Tessera now puts them in that layer itself; an app's unlayered `theme.css` still wins.
  - The search mascot clips are typed `MascotClip`. The widget options panel closes on its own and the widget body scrolls with a gutter, with no Brock code; Brock passes no window group prop.
  - The review drags a floating widget's corner with real mouse events (`review:widgetProbe` takes `mouse`), checks the new size and the 240 by 160 floor, and checks the guide card beside the pointer the probe passes (`guide` takes `pointer`; the facts add `guideBeside`).

## 0.14.0

## 0.13.0

### Minor Changes

- 33dc33c: Snap clusters replace manual window groups.

  - Every window joined by snap links, directly or through other windows, the main window included, is one cluster, computed from the live links. Dragging any window of a cluster moves the whole cluster rigidly; only the dragged window snaps, to windows outside the cluster, and what it is dropped against joins the cluster. Holding Ctrl while moving drags one window alone: it leaves the cluster, its links break (a window linked to it relinks to another window it is still flush with) and it can snap elsewhere. A window with no link moves alone as before.
  - Maximize, full screen with the black backdrop, minimize and restore act on the cluster, with the same fit and pack maths and the same restore. Closing a widget closes that widget alone. Resizing keeps the session rules and never moves a cluster.
  - Manual groups are gone: the `group` field of the popped layout, `WidgetWindowState` and the probe facts, `WidgetWindowGroup`, `widget:setGroup`, `widget:setMainGroup`, `widget:getMainGroup` and `widget:mainGroup`, the "Window group" wiring of `WidgetOptions` and `WindowTitleBar` (Brock no longer passes those props), and `config/window-group.json`, which main deletes at start. A `group` left in a saved popped entry is dropped when the layout loads, and the `drop-window-groups` upgrade step cleans the dev data under `.user-data`. `WidgetWindowSummary.group` becomes `cluster`, the number of windows in the cluster, and the probe's `group` request becomes `cluster`.
  - The window guide shows in the window being moved or resized, a widget window or the main window, instead of always in main: `widget:guide` goes to that window only. Its hints follow the new rules: snapped windows move together, Ctrl moves one window alone, flush windows resize together, Ctrl resizes one window alone without snapping.
  - A resize now moves every window on the dragged line: two widgets stacked against main's left edge both follow main's edge, and either widget's right edge moves main's edge and the other widget's; a window stacked end to end on the far side of the line follows too.
  - The review checks a cluster moving together and with main, a Ctrl move detaching, cluster maximize, restore and full screen, the guide drawn in the moved window and in main, and the stacked seam.

## 0.12.0

### Minor Changes

- f751683: Brock moves to Tessera 0.12.0 (brock-react's peer is `^0.12.0`). A widget window now draws Tessera's own pin menu in its title bar and Tessera's Pin row in its options panel, in place of Brock's `WidgetPinMenu` and the Stacking row; the pin stays off or on top, sync stays a separate option, and a saved `with-app` pin still opens as off with sync on. The `widget:popped` event carries the new `PoppedWidgetPatch`, whose pin is never `with-app`. The review reads the page header through the `content-header` classes.

## 0.11.0

### Minor Changes

- 48ca303: A built-in Performance widget every app gets, closed by default and listed in the Widgets menu: the renderer (frame rate and frame time, long tasks, event loop lag, JS heap, DOM nodes), every process from main (CPU and memory per process, main process memory, uptime, windows and widget windows with their sync and group, IPC calls per second, runtime versions, GPU compositing) and the app state (version, screen and route, profile, open widgets, modules, errors and warnings since start). Its options set the refresh and the sections shown, sampling stops while it is off screen, and Copy snapshot puts the numbers on the clipboard for a bug report. The new `diagnostics:getProcesses` channel (`getProcessDiagnostics`) feeds it, and the review opens it and checks the numbers move.

## 0.10.0

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- 28540bb: Widget windows: a direct pin choice, and resizing snapped windows moves only the dragged edge.

  - The pin is now `off` or `top`. The old `with-app` pin did what "Sync with main window" does, so the two are merged: a synced window also mirrors the app's always-on-top. `WidgetPinMode` drops `with-app`; the new `StoredPinMode` keeps it for saved popped entries, and a saved `with-app` pin opens as `off` with `sync` on and is written back to the layout.
  - The widget window bar shows Brock's `WidgetPinMenu` in place of Tessera's cycling pin button: a pin-off icon for a normal window, a highlighted pin and an "On top" label while pinned, and a menu listing both states with a hint and a check on the current one. The options panel has a "Stacking" row with the same two choices.
  - Resizing a widget window moves only the dragged edge, with edge snapping. The windows exactly flush against that edge have their facing edge moved with it, and nothing else changes size. Before, a neighbour whose own edge only lined up with the dragged one (the tops of two windows side by side) was stretched with it. Ctrl still resizes the window alone.
  - The main window's aspect lock applies to the main window alone. It used to be hooked onto every window created, widget windows included. The widget resize pipeline (`planResize`) now keeps the main window in proportion and never lets a widget's shared edge bend it.
  - The review's widget-windows step checks both pin states and captures the bar while pinned. It also resizes a snapped window from its outer edge and from the shared edge, and asserts the neighbour keeps its size apart from that edge.

## 0.8.1

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- dcdde4a: Widget windows sync with the main window, snap into a grid and act in groups. A popped window is now synced by default: on Windows the app window owns it, so it no longer falls behind other apps when the focus goes elsewhere, and it shows, hides, minimizes, restores and raises with the app. A per-widget "Sync with main window" switch makes it independent with its own taskbar entry. Moving snaps corners and edges, resizing snaps the moving edge to the neighbours' edges, and an edge shared by snapped windows resizes them all together; Ctrl skips snapping and resizes one window. The app and each widget can join a window group (1 to 4) whose members maximize, go full screen over a black backdrop with square corners, minimize, restore and close together. The app window shows a guide with the shortcuts while a widget window moves or resizes. Brock draws interim controls (`WindowGroupControls`, a "Window group" title bar action, `WindowGuideOverlay`) until Tessera ships its own. The `widget:*` contract gains `setSync`, `setGroup`, `setMainGroup`, `getMainGroup`, `mainGroup`, `guide` and `square`, and the window state carries `sync`, `group` and `square`.

## 0.7.1

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- f6cfba5: Brock takes Tessera 0.8.0 and its rimmed logos. `product.icons.rim` (`'light'` or `'dark'`) picks Tessera's `brand/<rim>-rim/<brand>/` set, and it defaults to `'light'` for the `brock` brand, so the mark reads on dark surfaces. `brock icons`, the splash mark, the bot variant, the installer and Setup splash mark read from that tree. `brock icons` also copies `icon-32.png` and `icon-24.png` to `public/logos/`, and with a brand `product.logos.app` defaults to `./logos/icon-32.png`, so the title bar no longer scales a 256 px icon down to 20 px and loses the rim. A copied file is skipped only when it holds the same bytes, so a rim switch recopies the set. The About panel draws a rimmed brand as its bare mark. Migration `gitignore-title-bar-logos` ignores the two new logo files.

## 0.6.1

## 0.6.0

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- ff027d0: The widget IPC contract grows for widget windows that work end to end: `WidgetWindowOpen` carries a `seq`, `at` (the drag-out screen point), `atCursor` and `taskbar`, `widget:closed` carries the window's `seq`, `widget:patchSettings` and `widget:settingsPatch` relay a settings change from a widget window to the app, and the review gets `review:widgetProbe` (`WidgetProbeRequest`, `WidgetProbeResult`) and `review:captureWidget`.

## 0.4.0

## 0.3.0

## 0.2.0

### Patch Changes

- f818087: Breaking: Brock moves to the next Tessera. The title bar menu is Tessera's hamburger `DropdownMenu`, built from `MenuGroup[]` by `toMenuGroups` in place of `toDropdownItems`, and a bucket or page `shortcut` shows beside its entry. `product.window.titleBar.controls` turns the fullscreen, pin, minimize and maximize buttons off; maximize and fullscreen off also make the main window not maximizable or fullscreenable. About shows the Tessera brand icon and wordmark when the product is that brand, the copy buttons write through `TesseraProvider` `overrides.writeText`, Hero facts take `FactsPanelGroup[]`, and the input module's device badges are `Status`. Migrations `progress-bar-tone` and `facts-panel-names` rewrite app code; `badge-status`, `tessera-provider-overrides`, `window-title-bar-config` and `dropdown-menu-groups` leave to-dos.

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- 25be8fe: `ProductConfig` drops its `modules` field. Nothing read it: the module list is the top-level `modules` of `brock.config.ts`, which `brock add` writes and `brock sync` reads.
- f60b232: `product.widgets.mainLabel` in `brock.config.ts` names the main view in the widget dock (default `Main`). The saved layout key stays `main`.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 0a52cd7: The gaps the first Archipelia app found, now in Brock. `product.ports` gives each app a port block, each thread worktree a slot of its own and the dev server `strictPort`; `create-brock` writes the base. `brock adopt` writes the knip entries and the `.gitignore` lines for generated outputs. `brock check` and `brock sync` run per app at a workspace root. `launchAppForTest` from `brock-build/testing` starts the built app headless for app e2e tests. New helpers: `confirmAction`, `useNow`, `useCopyText`, `useKeyedGuard`, `redactSecrets` and `lanAddresses()` with the `network:lanAddresses` channel.
- ade72f8: Breaking: the widget host moves to the Tessera WidgetManager v2 on DockLayout. Widgets dock in a split tree around the main view (the home or game view), float over it, or open in a window of their own when their definition sets `popOut: true`, with pin, snap, towing and drag back in handled by brock-electron over the new `widget:*` channels of brock-core. The layout is `{ v: 2, dock, floating, popped, frame }` and saved layouts migrate on load; `useWidgetLayoutStore` loses `update` and gains `change`, `setLayout` and `popOut`, and `StandardOverlays` no longer takes `widgets`. Hero pages draw the Tessera Hero composite and take its slots (`Title`, `Eyebrow`, `Backdrop`, `Art`, `Actions`, `Tools`, `Facts rows`, `Aside`, `Panel`). Migrations `widget-layout-v2` and `hero-slots` turn the old uses into to-dos. The input module draws its devices and calibration with Tessera's PressedGrid, StickPlot and CalibrationPanel, the update dialog and the bug report use Tessera's Small tones, a pref changed in a popped widget reaches the app and is saved with the profile, the main view grip shows only while dragging, and the review checks the dock (no grip at rest), a headless pop-out window (focus, a pref set there kept after the dock back, closing) and the hero slots.
- c48024b: The input module carries the SDL3 addon source, fetches its prebuild on install and before `brock dev` and `brock build`, and ships it in a packaged app through module manifest fields that the builder config reads.
- e406f70: `brock package` builds the small Windows installer, a downloader that reads `install.json` from the latest release and installs the payload it names, and writes that manifest with the entries carried forward from the previous release. A routine release is the update package only; `--full` adds the payload and the directory zip. The product config takes an optional `accent`, used for the installer progress bar and the downloader.
- fd0a736: The Windows installer is a template built from config. The downloader takes its colours from Tessera's dark theme (or its built-in colours until `tokens.json` exists), the gradient from the look and the mark from `public/logos/mark.svg`. Velopack's Setup splash is drawn from the same look, mark and name. `product.installer` sets the scope, the shortcuts, launch after install, an optional licence and the folder name, with rotp's behaviour as the default. `build/installer/header.png` and `build/installer/splash.png` replace the rendered images, and `brock package --render-installer` writes the screens to `release/installer-preview/`.
- 8498845: Platforms are separate ids (windows, macos, linux, android, web, with ios reserved) and bundles (desktop, mobile) in `targets`. Each one is a strategy with doctor checks, scaffold steps, CI and release jobs and secrets. `brock sync` composes `ci.yml` (lint, structure, tests and the headless review on Linux) and `release.yml` from them. create-brock asks for the platforms or takes `--platforms`; `platform add`, `remove` and `list`, `doctor` and `web build` are new commands. Android gets a Capacitor project in `mobile/android` with signing from the environment, `mobile build --release` and `mobile keystore`; Linux debs install module udev rules.
- f62f048: Every app gets a `--review` automation flag: a headless tour of the shell that captures a screenshot per step, checks the title bar, menu, screens, Escape, palette, bug report, About and widgets, and writes a report with exit code 0 or 1. Escape now closes the title bar menu, palette results draw their icons, About rows keep a gap, and `brock start` launches the app folder so the app version applies.
- ae6b8e2: The shell matches the reference app out of the box: logos, window icon, splashes and the home screen come from the product config, screens and hubs share one framed card, Escape opens home, and the menu has sections, icons, a Dev Console and Credits.
- 14c3674: The splash window is now the only loading screen. It has no frame, border, radius or shadow, a gradient from `product.look` (else the Tessera brand gradient, else the palette seeds through `resolveLook`), the brand mark without its tile, the app name, a status line, a bottom progress bar and the version. The app window stays hidden at its restored bounds until every boot task is done and the home screen has painted, then the two crossfade over 220 ms. Boot tasks are standard: `defineBootTask` in `src/boot/<id>.task.ts` and `electron/boot/<id>.task.ts`, listed by `brock sync` in `.brock/boot.*.ts`, plus module `bootTasks`, run in order with timeouts and weighted progress. A failed task or the watchdog shows the error on the splash with Retry, Open logs and Quit. The boot splash inside `index.html`, `BootProgressBar`, `bootProgress` and `window:shellReady` are gone. `--screenshot-splash=<name>` captures the splash, and the review checks that the splash closed, the app stayed hidden during boot and no loading overlay is left in the app.
- 2cc7040: The splash picks light or dark text by contrast against its gradient, from Tessera's theme text and background colours when they are available.
- a8a87be: Apps update and ship the way Relic of the Past does. The update dialog no longer opens by itself: a found update shows as a badge on a version tag in the title bar, which modules reach through the new `RendererModule.titleBar` slot. `brock package` builds the app tree, the Windows installer with the app icon and a splash, and the Velopack update packages. `create-brock` and `brock adopt` write a release workflow that packages every platform and publishes to GitHub Releases with `release-notes/v<version>.md` as the body, and `brock release` dispatches it.

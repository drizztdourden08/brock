### Minor Changes

- 70d80cf: Brock moves to Tessera ^0.16.1 and standards ^0.7.0, which Tessera 0.16's lint extension needs. Breaking: `BackTitle` and `BackTitleProps`, `titleBarMenu`, the `focus` option of `confirmAction` and the `ConfirmFocus` type are gone, replaced by Tessera's header Back buttons, title bar dropdowns and danger dialogs; migration `shell-workarounds-removed` lists each use. StackedBar comes from the primitives, the faint text colour is gone from Brock's styles, Brock's stylesheets name no Tessera internals, and the bug report fields take the full dialog width now that Field stops at 512 px.

### Patch Changes

- 70d80cf: The generated `.brock` files are never linted: `brockEslint` ignores `**/.brock/**`, the templates list it, and migration `eslint-brock-ignore` adds it to the ESLint config of the app and of the workspace root.
- 70d80cf: `brock sync` runs `tessera guide` when `tessera.config.json` sets `guide.parts`, and a new app sets it to `.brock/tessera-parts.ts`. Migration `guide-parts` asks an app to set it and to delete a hand-written parts list (archipelia-36, brock-24).

## 0.17.0

### Minor Changes

- 3a35c8e: An IPC channel is declared once: `defineChannels({ engineStatus: invoke<() => Promise<EngineStatus>>()('ap:engine:status'), onProgress: event<(p: number) => void>()('ap:engine:progress') })` from brock-core gives the preload maps (`maps.invoke`, `maps.send`, `maps.events`), the augmentation types (`InvokeContractOf`, `SendContractOf`, `EventContractOf`) and typed entries: main's `handle`, `on` and `emit` take an entry in place of the channel name, and brock-react's `channelApi(APP_CHANNELS)` types the renderer calls by method name. Channels written in the augmentation, a map and a handler keep working. The new app declares its channels this way, knip treats `src/ipc/contract.type.ts` as an entry, and the `channel-declarations` migration lists, as one to-do, every channel an app could move. docs/ipc.md shows both styles.
- 3a35c8e: Handler groups are picked up by file name: `brock sync` writes `.brock/handlers.main.ts` (`mainHandlers`) from `electron/handlers/<subject>-handlers.ts`, each exporting `<subject>Handlers`, and a change in that folder makes `.brock` stale. The new app passes `handlers: mainHandlers`. The `handlers-by-file` migration rewrites `electron/main.ts` the same way when its hand list (in `electron/handlers/index.ts` or inline) names exactly those groups, removing an index that held only the list, and leaves a to-do with both lists otherwise.
- 3a35c8e: Apps add their own review steps: each `src/review/<id>.step.ts` (default export `defineReviewStep({ run })`) runs as step `<id>` after the built-in steps, in the same report. `run(tour)` gets the built-in helpers: `check`, `report`, `capture` (named `<id>-<name>`), `find`, `findAll`, `click`, `hover`, `typeText` (inputs and textareas), `press`, `waitFor`, `settle`, `delay`, `openScreen`, `openWidget`, `resetUi`, plus `platform` and `api`. A step that finishes gets a passing `step-ran` check, and an id that is a built-in step's name fails. `brock structure` accepts `<id>.step.ts` files and the lint preset allows their default export. The new app ships `src/review/notes.step.ts`.
- 3a35c8e: The review tours the app's real content: `src/review/seed.ts` (default export `defineReviewSeed({ run })`) runs as the `seed` step right after the profile step, so the screens and widgets that follow are captured with data. The seed fills the app through its own channels, a store, or fixture files written with `tour.platform.files`. `brock sync` lists it in `.brock/review.ts`, `src/main.tsx` passes `review={appReview}` to `BrockApp` (the `review-files` migration adds it), and the new app writes a note for the Notes widget. docs/review-steps.md shows how to write one.
- e70afc3: File storage per data domain: `ctx.storage.domain(id)` in main and `dataDomain(id)` in the renderer read and write JSON, text and bytes, list, remove and size files, with every path kept inside the domain folder. A built-in `StoragePage`, added to a bucket as a page file, shows each domain's size with Open folder, Clear and "older than N days" clean rules (both confirmed), and exports chosen domains to a zip or a folder and imports them back. New template apps declare two domains and carry the page.
- e70afc3: An app puts its own items in the title bar without a module: `src/title-bar/<id>.action.ts` default-exports `defineTitleBarItem({ kind: 'button' | 'menu' | 'status', ... })` or a hook that returns one. `brock sync` writes `.brock/title-bar.ts` and `BrockApp` takes it as `titleBar`. A `menu` item opens a dropdown of its own, a `status` item is a tag drawn while its status is set, and every item folds into the main menu when the bar is narrow. App items come after Search, Report a bug and the module items, whose order stays fixed. The `title-bar-files` migration wires `src/main.tsx`.
- 87fa9a3: A default widget layout and Reset layout. `src/widgets/layout.ts` default-exports `defineLayoutPreset({ rows, sizes, widths })`: rows of widget ids around the `main` view, with an array of ids tabbing them in one pane. `brock sync` exports it from `.brock/widgets.ts` as `appWidgetLayout` (undefined without the file), and `src/main.tsx` passes `widgetLayout={appWidgetLayout}` to `BrockApp`. A profile with no saved layout starts from it, and `meta.defaultOpen` opens a widget the preset does not place on its default side. `widgets.reset()` and the new Reset layout entry at the end of the Widgets menu put the layout back to that default. The `widget-layout-prop` migration wires `src/main.tsx`; the template ships a layout with Notes beside the main view.

## 0.12.0

### Minor Changes

- 59c1c9d: Brock moves to Tessera 0.13.0 (brock-react's peer is `^0.13.0`).

  - Palettes: `BrockApp` imports Tessera's brand palettes into the `ds.palette` layer and sets `data-palette` on the document root to `product.icons.brand`, in the main window and in popped widget windows. The starter `src/theme.css` sets no seeds and only overrides; the `brock-palette` upgrade step turns an untouched starter theme (the old blue or the Brock seeds) into that override-only file and keeps a theme the app changed. The splash, the look and the installer read the brand palette while `theme.css` sets no seeds.
  - Breaking for hero homes: `Art` takes a `kind` (`image` or `node`), `Backdrop` takes Tessera's `HeroBackdrop` (`node`, `image`, `color`) or `kind: 'none'`, and the new `Shade` slot takes `value`. The `hero-kinds` upgrade step adds `kind="image"` to art and turns a `Backdrop` with children into a to-do.
  - About has no page header, as Tessera's InfoScreen now draws none; the screen declares the new `header: 'none'` and the review checks that no header shows.
  - The search mascot comes from Tessera's `mascotForBrand`; Brock's own brand to mascot table is gone.

  - @drizztdourden08/brock-build@0.12.0

## 0.11.0

### Minor Changes

- d3e8420: The starter app takes the Brock palette (orange, charcoal and greys, matching the Brock logo) in place of the old blue. The `brock-palette` upgrade step rewrites an app's `src/theme.css` only when it still holds the untouched old starter seeds.
- 54d913a: Widgets by convention, placed like screens: an app's widgets are `src/widgets/<id>.widget.tsx` files whose default export is the component and whose `meta` holds the label, icon, popOut, devOnly, visibility, side and sizes. `brock sync` and the dev server write `.brock/widgets.ts`, and `BrockApp` takes it as the new `widgets` prop; `defineWidget`, `registerWidgets` and module widgets keep working. `brock structure` checks the folder, the lint config lets widget files export `meta` beside their default export, the starter app has a Notes widget, and `brock adopt` gives each app of a workspace its own views and prints where every kind of code goes. The `widget-files` migration wires `src/main.tsx` and lists every hand-made widget as a to-do naming its new file. Brock's own Logs and Performance widgets follow the same layout inside brock-react, and `docs/app-structure.md` maps where every piece of an app goes.

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- a265770: Brock takes Tessera 0.10.0. The catalog and the brock-react peer move to `^0.10.0`.

  - `brock migrate` replays the new `configKeys` group of Tessera's `RENAMES.json`: dotted setting paths moved inside JSON files a project keeps, by file name, where `*` stands for any one key such as an app folder. The step edits `tessera.config.json` and `package.json` at the app root, the repo root and every workspace package in place. A key whose parent stays the same is renamed where it stands, an object whose every key moves to the same new sibling is renamed whole, and any other key is cut and pasted at the indentation of its new place, with an emptied parent removed. Order, layout and indentation are kept, a second run changes nothing, and a target that is already set is never overwritten: it becomes a to-do. For Tessera 0.10.0 that moves the usage settings object to `guide`, at the top level and under each `apps` entry, and the `package.json` guide script to `guide`.
  - Brock's own `tessera.config.json` holds `guide`, and the prose exception for the old key is gone.

## 0.8.1

### Patch Changes

- 03dcade: Standards moved to 0.x: Brock depends on `@drizztdourden08/standards` ^0.6.0 and calls its shared workflows at `@v0`. The family never takes a major version; `standards sync --check` now rejects a changeset that asks for one.

## 0.8.0

### Patch Changes

- 98b5318: Take standards 1.0.5, which bans tool and vendor names in prose, strings and identifiers and skips every path git ignores. Every folder that needs ignoring is a dot-folder: the repo, the app template and `brock adopt` ignore them all with `.*/`, with a `!` line per tracked dot-folder. New `brock knip` runs knip with the git-ignored paths, so it works in a worktree inside a dot-folder; the lint and deadcode scripts use it. The thread CLI finds `tools/brock-plugin-*/index.mjs` inside any top-level dot-folder instead of two named folders, and the trailer check rejects co-author lines, "generated with/by" lines and the robot emoji without naming a tool.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- becd8b0: Brock reads the app layout from `tessera.config.json`. The splash look, the splash token sheet and the installer take the app theme from `theme.css` of that file (with the app's `apps` entry merged in), through the app's own `@drizztdourden08/tessera/config`, and keep `src/theme.css` when there is no file or the installed Tessera has no config entry; a file that breaks the schema stops with an error naming it. `appThemeCss(rootDir)` is the new `@drizztdourden08/brock-build/theme` entry, and the managed `stylelint.config.mjs` takes its token file from it. A new app carries a root `tessera.config.json` with `$schema` alone. `brock adopt` writes one when it is missing: `$schema` alone for a single app, `package`, `parts` and one `apps` entry per app when the repo has `packages/design`.

### Patch Changes

- 1f2ce71: `brock structure` and `brock prose` run the checks of `@drizztdourden08/standards`, with Brock's extension in `brock-build/standards.extension.mjs`: `brock.config.ts` marks an app, `build/installer` and `src/screens` keep their own checks, `<id>.task.ts` is a module file. Installing `brock-build` is enough for `standards structure` to load it. Breaking: the `brock.designSystem` flag is gone; list `@drizztdourden08/standards/extensions/usage-files` in `standards.config.mjs` instead. `brock adopt` and `create-brock` take `.npmrc`, `.jscpd.json` and the knip schema from the standards templates, and the generated `eslint.config.mjs` names the `react-app` preset. `brock-thread` checks PR text with the shared writing lists from standards.
- Brock takes Tessera 0.4.0: SectionNav is SideNav and HeaderTabs is HeaderAnchorNav (replayed with Brock's own Tessera renames step), the title bar menu, the fixed-head search results and the config loader are the published ones.

  New apps' knip ignores `@drizztdourden08/standards`, whose stylelint plugins it sees through brock-lint-config; the `standards-lint-deps` upgrade step does the same for an existing app and drops `typescript-eslint` and `eslint-plugin-react-hooks`, which standards now carries.

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- 567636a: `--tessera registry` keeps the published Tessera while `--local` links Brock, so an app is not tied to a Tessera working copy that is being edited.
- Updated dependencies [7f38965]
  - @drizztdourden08/brock-build@0.1.2

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 0a52cd7: The gaps the first Archipelia app found, now in Brock. `product.ports` gives each app a port block, each thread worktree a slot of its own and the dev server `strictPort`; `create-brock` writes the base. `brock adopt` writes the knip entries and the `.gitignore` lines for generated outputs. `brock check` and `brock sync` run per app at a workspace root. `launchAppForTest` from `brock-build/testing` starts the built app headless for app e2e tests. New helpers: `confirmAction`, `useNow`, `useCopyText`, `useKeyedGuard`, `redactSecrets` and `lanAddresses()` with the `network:lanAddresses` channel.
- 568c900: An app on another Windows drive than its linked Brock checkout keeps its links: `create-brock --local`, `brock add --local`, `brock adopt --local` and `upgrade --local` add `prefer-frozen-lockfile=false` to `.npmrc` (and `pnpm-lock.yaml text eol=lf` to `.gitattributes`) when a `link:` spec crosses drives, so later installs resolve the links instead of joining `X:/...` to the app folder.
- f6a334e: A scaffolded app is a git repository with its first commit, `launch main` runs the main checkout, and the closing steps name the app's own command.
- c1c29a0: The repo command runs Brock in its own checkout when called from outside it, and a worktree install no longer rewrites the machine shims. Scaffolded and adopted apps route the scope to GitHub Packages in their .npmrc.
- 8498845: Platforms are separate ids (windows, macos, linux, android, web, with ios reserved) and bundles (desktop, mobile) in `targets`. Each one is a strategy with doctor checks, scaffold steps, CI and release jobs and secrets. `brock sync` composes `ci.yml` (lint, structure, tests and the headless review on Linux) and `release.yml` from them. create-brock asks for the platforms or takes `--platforms`; `platform add`, `remove` and `list`, `doctor` and `web build` are new commands. Android gets a Capacitor project in `mobile/android` with signing from the environment, `mobile build --release` and `mobile keystore`; Linux debs install module udev rules.
- 068a02d: Screens by convention: files in src/screens become bucket hubs, pages, tabs, settings pages, cards and custom screens through a generated .brock/screens.ts, with the menu, bucket switch, Escape home and settings placement read from screens.config.ts. brock structure checks the layout, the review opens every generated screen, and the template app uses it.
- b1fa12d: Breaking: a full-bleed screen at the root of src/screens is now `<id>.layer.tsx`, and `<page>.custom.tsx` names a custom page inside a bucket; migration custom-layer-rename renames each root `.custom.tsx` and lists it in the report, and knip-custom-pages adds custom pages to the knip entries. Search now reads one index for the palette and every hub: `brock sync` and the dev server write `.brock/search.ts` from the screens, their `meta.keywords`, the settings rows and each custom page's `searchEntries`, without loading any page, and modules, widgets, the menu, actions and `useSearchEntries` join at runtime. Generated hubs have search on, grouped by page, Ctrl+K inside a hub focuses it, a result opens its page and flashes its row, `brock structure` fails a custom page without `searchEntries` and counts them per bucket, and the review searches a sample from each source in the palette and in a hub.
- ae6b8e2: The shell matches the reference app out of the box: logos, window icon, splashes and the home screen come from the product config, screens and hubs share one framed card, Escape opens home, and the menu has sections, icons, a Dev Console and Credits.
- a8a87be: Apps update and ship the way Relic of the Past does. The update dialog no longer opens by itself: a found update shows as a badge on a version tag in the title bar, which modules reach through the new `RendererModule.titleBar` slot. `brock package` builds the app tree, the Windows installer with the app icon and a splash, and the Velopack update packages. `create-brock` and `brock adopt` write a release workflow that packages every platform and publishes to GitHub Releases with `release-notes/v<version>.md` as the body, and `brock release` dispatches it.
- e2cf0ee: Every new app starts with the updater: create-brock records it and adds the module and its velopack peer in registry and local link mode. The title bar drops the permanent version tag and shows an "Update available" badge only when an update is found, the update dialog follows the reference layout and says plainly when the app has no update source, and the review tool checks the menu entry, the dialog and its Escape.
- 97496b7: Apps pin Brock once in `package.json#brock.version`, and sync, adopt and create-brock keep every Brock dependency on it. `brock migrate` runs the migrations Brock packages ship, and `<app> upgrade [version] [--check] [--no-review]` moves an app to a release in its own worktree, proves it with the gate and the headless review, and commits when green. Breaking: BrockApp no longer takes logoSrc or instanceLogoSrc (migration brock-app-logo-src), a non-boolean setting row needs a control (migration base-setting-controls), the built-in About menu entry replaces an app's own (migration menu-built-in-about), and .gitignore gains the files newer Brock generates (migration gitignore-generated-files).

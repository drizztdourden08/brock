### Patch Changes

- 73a287e: Importing a data area asks Merge (the default) or Replace in its confirm dialog (`confirmChoice`, a confirm dialog with a radio group). Merge keeps what is there and keeps the newer file when both have the same path; `storage:applyImport` takes the mode, the result counts the kept files (`kept`), and imported files keep the modified time they were exported with.
- 73a287e: Zip exports write zip64 records past 65535 files or 4 GB, and the reader follows them, so a zip export has no practical limit.

## 0.21.1

### Patch Changes

- 0e425f6: Snapping no longer stays off after a Ctrl move or resize. Main only knew Ctrl from the key and mouse events of Brock windows, so a Ctrl release it never received kept it believing Ctrl was held: on Windows the move and resize loop takes the keyboard, so letting go of Ctrl during a drag never reached the window, and a release while another app had the focus, or with the cursor only over title strips and borders, was lost too. Every later drag then moved one window alone and every resize ran without snapping or shared edges, for every window, until some unrelated event said otherwise. Main now forgets Ctrl when a move or a resize ends (on macOS, where `moved` comes on every step, only when a resize ends) and when no Brock window has the focus any more, so the next plain drag moves the cluster and snaps again, and a window moved alone with Ctrl rejoins on its next plain drag. Ctrl held through the next drag is read again from that window's key repeat or mouse events.
- 0e425f6: Widget windows restored at launch no longer appear before the app window. They are created hidden and held until the app window is revealed after boot; the reveal waits for them to be ready to show (at most 1.5 s each), then shows the app window and every held widget window in the same tick, each at opacity 0, and fades them in together with the same 220 ms ramp. Widget windows still show without taking the focus, synced ones stay owned by the app window, and on an automation launch (`--no-focus`) they stay off screen. A widget window that becomes ready during the fade fades in too; one opened after the launch shows at once, as before. Boot holds added while the reveal waits for others are now waited for as well.

## 0.19.0

### Minor Changes

- df9c1df: Brock moves to Tessera 0.17.0: the workspace catalog and brock-react's peer range are `^0.17.0`. Small text is 12 px, and Field labels and DataTable headers are no longer forced to capitals (Archipelia review T-03). Two new settings control kinds: `path` (`pick`, `accept`, `placeholder`) draws Tessera's `PathField` on a string setting, with typing, a drop from the desktop and Browse, and `json` (`shape`) draws `JsonInput`, which saves the value only while the text parses. They come with new optional platform ports, `filePicker.pickPath`, `filePicker.pathOf` and `storage.revealLogs`, which the Electron host fills through the new `dialog:pickPath` and `debug:revealLogs` channels and the preload's `getFilePath`. `brock upgrade` writes `StatusOf` as `Status` from Tessera's `RENAMES.json`, and the `tessera-part-moves` migration moves `CopyButton`, `CopyValue` and their types from `/primitives` to `/composites`, and `ErrorBoundary` from `/composites` to `/primitives`.

## 0.17.0

### Minor Changes

- 3a35c8e: Main has a place for app services: `bootstrapApp(product, { services: (ctx) => createAppServices(ctx) })` builds them once, at the start of the modules boot task (after the paths, before the handlers), exposes them as `ctx.services`, typed through the new `AppServices` augmentation, and calls their `dispose()` on will-quit. Reading `ctx.services` before the build, or without the option, throws and says which. The `app-services` migration turns a WeakMap memo keyed by `MainContext` into a to-do.
- 3a35c8e: An IPC channel is declared once: `defineChannels({ engineStatus: invoke<() => Promise<EngineStatus>>()('ap:engine:status'), onProgress: event<(p: number) => void>()('ap:engine:progress') })` from brock-core gives the preload maps (`maps.invoke`, `maps.send`, `maps.events`), the augmentation types (`InvokeContractOf`, `SendContractOf`, `EventContractOf`) and typed entries: main's `handle`, `on` and `emit` take an entry in place of the channel name, and brock-react's `channelApi(APP_CHANNELS)` types the renderer calls by method name. Channels written in the augmentation, a map and a handler keep working. The new app declares its channels this way, knip treats `src/ipc/contract.type.ts` as an entry, and the `channel-declarations` migration lists, as one to-do, every channel an app could move. docs/ipc.md shows both styles.
- e70afc3: Long jobs: `ctx.job(id, steps)` in main reports steps, weighted progress, the current line and log lines to the renderer and stops on cancel through its `signal`. `JobDialog` draws a job with Tessera's Stepper, ProgressBar and LogPanel, `useJob(id)` and `jobs.open(id)` drive it, and Hide moves a running job to a status tag in the title bar that reopens it.
- e70afc3: `openExternal(url)` from `@drizztdourden08/brock-electron/main` opens a link through the same protocol allow list as the renderer (`security.externalProtocols`), so app main code no longer calls Electron's `shell.openExternal` directly. A refused link is logged and resolves false.
- e70afc3: File storage per data domain: `ctx.storage.domain(id)` in main and `dataDomain(id)` in the renderer read and write JSON, text and bytes, list, remove and size files, with every path kept inside the domain folder. A built-in `StoragePage`, added to a bucket as a page file, shows each domain's size with Open folder, Clear and "older than N days" clean rules (both confirmed), and exports chosen domains to a zip or a folder and imports them back. New template apps declare two domains and carry the page.

### Patch Changes

- e70afc3: `storage:getSummary` no longer stats every file one after another: it lists each domain folder in one pass and stats 32 files at a time, the domains side by side. `storage:getDomainUsage` measures one domain, so a page can show each as it arrives.

## 0.16.0

### Patch Changes

- 55befe4: The review watchdog starts in main at launch. When no tour progress (a capture or a check) arrives within 60 s, for example because the renderer failed to load, main writes a partial report with a failed `tour-started` check and exits 1, instead of waiting for minutes. Main also exits 5 s after the report when something holds the quit. brock-core exports `GLOBAL_STEP` from its review entry.
- 55befe4: Every `--review` run captures the splash mid-boot as step 00 (`00-splash.png`, or `00-splash-failed.png` when the boot stops first) and adds a `splash-captured` check, without `--screenshot-splash`. The reveal waits for the capture, at most 5 s. `--screenshot-splash` works as before.

## 0.15.0

### Minor Changes

- 96f7759: The Performance widget is drawn with Tessera's chart parts.

  - A row of `StatTile`s for frame rate, CPU, memory and event loop lag, each with its change since the last sample and a `Sparkline` of the last 60 samples; `Gauge`s for the app's CPU, its share of system memory and the JS heap, sized to fit; a `StackedBar` of memory by process (main, renderer, GPU, utility, widget windows); an Activity list of long tasks, errors and warnings; and every reading in a collapsed Details section.
  - A container query puts two tiles a row when docked and four a row, with the gauges beside memory and activity, from 560 px. The widget no longer wraps itself in a `ScrollArea`; the widget body scrolls.
  - The refresh and sections options, Copy snapshot and sampling only while shown stay as they were.
  - `ProcessDiagnostics` adds `memoryTotalBytes`, and each `ProcessMetric` adds `window`, the Brock window a renderer process draws (`main` or a widget id).
  - The review checks that the tiles, sparklines, gauges and memory bar render and move, that the panel adds no scroll box of its own, and captures the widget docked and popped out narrow and wide.

- 96f7759: Brock takes Tessera 0.15.0 (peer range `^0.15.0`).

  - Floating widgets resize from every edge and corner; `WidgetHost` passes `floatingMin` of 240 by 160, the least size of a widget window, so a floating widget and a popped one stop at the same size.
  - The window guide sits beside the cursor in the window being moved or resized: main reads `screen.getCursorScreenPoint()` on every `will-move` and `will-resize`, turns it into that window's client pixels and sends it as `pointer` with the `widget:guide` state (`WindowGuideState.pointer`), and `WindowGuide` passes it to `WindowGuideOverlay`.
  - `BrockApp.css` imports the brand palettes without `layer(ds.palette)`, since Tessera now puts them in that layer itself; an app's unlayered `theme.css` still wins.
  - The search mascot clips are typed `MascotClip`. The widget options panel closes on its own and the widget body scrolls with a gutter, with no Brock code; Brock passes no window group prop.
  - The review drags a floating widget's corner with real mouse events (`review:widgetProbe` takes `mouse`), checks the new size and the 240 by 160 floor, and checks the guide card beside the pointer the probe passes (`guide` takes `pointer`; the facts add `guideBeside`).

## 0.14.0

### Minor Changes

- add0686: Snapped edges are locked together, and clusters come from geometry.

  - A snap cluster is every window that touches the dragged one, directly or through others, main included: flush edges within 1 DIP that overlap, or a shared corner. It is taken from the window bounds when a move or resize starts, joined with the saved links, so a window touching two others, or snapped corner to corner, moves with the cluster. Dragging main or any widget moves the whole cluster; Ctrl, held at the start or pressed during the drag, moves the dragged window alone and takes it out.
  - Resizing moves every edge on the dragged line: the facing edges across the seam as before, and now the edges on the same side that line up within 1 DIP and meet a window already on the line, such as the left edges of two stacked widgets or a widget's bottom lined up with main's bottom. One window at its minimum size stops the whole line. Ctrl resizes the dragged window alone without snapping, which takes its edge off the line. Main with an aspect lock never follows a widget.
  - Snapping during a resize still ignores lines that move with the drag, but keeps the other edge of a window that follows on one side.
  - The window guide hints say touching windows move together, lined-up or touching edges move with the dragged edge, and an aspect-locked app keeps its shape.
  - The review's outer-edge, shared-edge, Ctrl and flush-bottom checks expect the locked edges.

### Patch Changes

- @drizztdourden08/brock-core@0.14.0

## 0.13.0

### Minor Changes

- 33dc33c: Snap clusters replace manual window groups.

  - Every window joined by snap links, directly or through other windows, the main window included, is one cluster, computed from the live links. Dragging any window of a cluster moves the whole cluster rigidly; only the dragged window snaps, to windows outside the cluster, and what it is dropped against joins the cluster. Holding Ctrl while moving drags one window alone: it leaves the cluster, its links break (a window linked to it relinks to another window it is still flush with) and it can snap elsewhere. A window with no link moves alone as before.
  - Maximize, full screen with the black backdrop, minimize and restore act on the cluster, with the same fit and pack maths and the same restore. Closing a widget closes that widget alone. Resizing keeps the session rules and never moves a cluster.
  - Manual groups are gone: the `group` field of the popped layout, `WidgetWindowState` and the probe facts, `WidgetWindowGroup`, `widget:setGroup`, `widget:setMainGroup`, `widget:getMainGroup` and `widget:mainGroup`, the "Window group" wiring of `WidgetOptions` and `WindowTitleBar` (Brock no longer passes those props), and `config/window-group.json`, which main deletes at start. A `group` left in a saved popped entry is dropped when the layout loads, and the `drop-window-groups` upgrade step cleans the dev data under `.user-data`. `WidgetWindowSummary.group` becomes `cluster`, the number of windows in the cluster, and the probe's `group` request becomes `cluster`.
  - The window guide shows in the window being moved or resized, a widget window or the main window, instead of always in main: `widget:guide` goes to that window only. Its hints follow the new rules: snapped windows move together, Ctrl moves one window alone, flush windows resize together, Ctrl resizes one window alone without snapping.
  - A resize now moves every window on the dragged line: two widgets stacked against main's left edge both follow main's edge, and either widget's right edge moves main's edge and the other widget's; a window stacked end to end on the far side of the line follows too.
  - The review checks a cluster moving together and with main, a Ctrl move detaching, cluster maximize, restore and full screen, the guide drawn in the moved window and in main, and the stacked seam.

## 0.12.0

### Minor Changes

- f751683: Brock moves to Tessera 0.12.0 (brock-react's peer is `^0.12.0`). A widget window now draws Tessera's own pin menu in its title bar and Tessera's Pin row in its options panel, in place of Brock's `WidgetPinMenu` and the Stacking row; the pin stays off or on top, sync stays a separate option, and a saved `with-app` pin still opens as off with sync on. The `widget:popped` event carries the new `PoppedWidgetPatch`, whose pin is never `with-app`. The review reads the page header through the `content-header` classes.

### Patch Changes

- f2b86ff: Always on top holds on Windows: a pinned widget window, synced or not, and the pinned app window now ask for the `pop-up-menu` level there. Electron put the default `floating` level behind the taskbar, which could drop the window out of the topmost band at once or on a later focus.

## 0.11.0

### Minor Changes

- 48ca303: A built-in Performance widget every app gets, closed by default and listed in the Widgets menu: the renderer (frame rate and frame time, long tasks, event loop lag, JS heap, DOM nodes), every process from main (CPU and memory per process, main process memory, uptime, windows and widget windows with their sync and group, IPC calls per second, runtime versions, GPU compositing) and the app state (version, screen and route, profile, open widgets, modules, errors and warnings since start). Its options set the refresh and the sections shown, sampling stops while it is off screen, and Copy snapshot puts the numbers on the clipboard for a bug report. The new `diagnostics:getProcesses` channel (`getProcessDiagnostics`) feeds it, and the review opens it and checks the numbers move.

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- 28540bb: Widget windows: a direct pin choice, and resizing snapped windows moves only the dragged edge.

  - The pin is now `off` or `top`. The old `with-app` pin did what "Sync with main window" does, so the two are merged: a synced window also mirrors the app's always-on-top. `WidgetPinMode` drops `with-app`; the new `StoredPinMode` keeps it for saved popped entries, and a saved `with-app` pin opens as `off` with `sync` on and is written back to the layout.
  - The widget window bar shows Brock's `WidgetPinMenu` in place of Tessera's cycling pin button: a pin-off icon for a normal window, a highlighted pin and an "On top" label while pinned, and a menu listing both states with a hint and a check on the current one. The options panel has a "Stacking" row with the same two choices.
  - Resizing a widget window moves only the dragged edge, with edge snapping. The windows exactly flush against that edge have their facing edge moved with it, and nothing else changes size. Before, a neighbour whose own edge only lined up with the dragged one (the tops of two windows side by side) was stretched with it. Ctrl still resizes the window alone.
  - The main window's aspect lock applies to the main window alone. It used to be hooked onto every window created, widget windows included. The widget resize pipeline (`planResize`) now keeps the main window in proportion and never lets a widget's shared edge bend it.
  - The review's widget-windows step checks both pin states and captures the bar while pinned. It also resizes a snapped window from its outer edge and from the shared edge, and asserts the neighbour keeps its size apart from that edge.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- dcdde4a: Widget windows sync with the main window, snap into a grid and act in groups. A popped window is now synced by default: on Windows the app window owns it, so it no longer falls behind other apps when the focus goes elsewhere, and it shows, hides, minimizes, restores and raises with the app. A per-widget "Sync with main window" switch makes it independent with its own taskbar entry. Moving snaps corners and edges, resizing snaps the moving edge to the neighbours' edges, and an edge shared by snapped windows resizes them all together; Ctrl skips snapping and resizes one window. The app and each widget can join a window group (1 to 4) whose members maximize, go full screen over a black backdrop with square corners, minimize, restore and close together. The app window shows a guide with the shortcuts while a widget window moves or resizes. Brock draws interim controls (`WindowGroupControls`, a "Window group" title bar action, `WindowGuideOverlay`) until Tessera ships its own. The `widget:*` contract gains `setSync`, `setGroup`, `setMainGroup`, `getMainGroup`, `mainGroup`, `guide` and `square`, and the window state carries `sync`, `group` and `square`.

### Patch Changes

- b7c919a: A window group maximized or put in full screen on a small display now stays inside the work area. When a window's minimum size stops the proportional scale, the group's shared edges are repacked so every member fits, keeps its order and stays flush with its neighbours. Restore still returns each window's exact bounds.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 241d164: Widget windows work end to end. A linked window is towed by the edge it sits on, so resizing the app from any side keeps it flush, and maximize or fullscreen hides the windows linked to the app until it is back to normal. Towed moves report their bounds, pending reports are flushed when the app closes or quits, and links survive a restart. The app snaps to widget windows with the same 14 px rule and links the one it lands against. A window lost after a display change comes back into a work area; a plain drag is left to the OS and no snap fights a move across displays of another scale. The `devOnly`, context-only and `show` gates close and reopen popped widgets, which keep their place. A drag-out opens the window at the release point: `onPopOut(id, point?: ScreenPoint)` is accepted ahead of Tessera 0.7.0, with the cursor as the fallback. Drop-in turns the window translucent over the app, ignores a drop where another widget window covers the app, and no longer loses a release between two renders; dock-backs carry a sequence number, Alt+F4 closes the widget, widget windows stay off the taskbar unless a definition sets `taskbar: true`, and followers come back without taking the focus. Widget windows get the active profile and the settings, with changes sent back to the app, and the log arrives as increments. The review drives all of it in a new `widget-windows` step.

### Patch Changes

- f818087: Breaking: Brock moves to the next Tessera. The title bar menu is Tessera's hamburger `DropdownMenu`, built from `MenuGroup[]` by `toMenuGroups` in place of `toDropdownItems`, and a bucket or page `shortcut` shows beside its entry. `product.window.titleBar.controls` turns the fullscreen, pin, minimize and maximize buttons off; maximize and fullscreen off also make the main window not maximizable or fullscreenable. About shows the Tessera brand icon and wordmark when the product is that brand, the copy buttons write through `TesseraProvider` `overrides.writeText`, Hero facts take `FactsPanelGroup[]`, and the input module's device badges are `Status`. Migrations `progress-bar-tone` and `facts-panel-names` rewrite app code; `badge-status`, `tessera-provider-overrides`, `window-title-bar-config` and `dropdown-menu-groups` leave to-dos.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 0a52cd7: The gaps the first Archipelia app found, now in Brock. `product.ports` gives each app a port block, each thread worktree a slot of its own and the dev server `strictPort`; `create-brock` writes the base. `brock adopt` writes the knip entries and the `.gitignore` lines for generated outputs. `brock check` and `brock sync` run per app at a workspace root. `launchAppForTest` from `brock-build/testing` starts the built app headless for app e2e tests. New helpers: `confirmAction`, `useNow`, `useCopyText`, `useKeyedGuard`, `redactSecrets` and `lanAddresses()` with the `network:lanAddresses` channel.
- ade72f8: Breaking: the widget host moves to the Tessera WidgetManager v2 on DockLayout. Widgets dock in a split tree around the main view (the home or game view), float over it, or open in a window of their own when their definition sets `popOut: true`, with pin, snap, towing and drag back in handled by brock-electron over the new `widget:*` channels of brock-core. The layout is `{ v: 2, dock, floating, popped, frame }` and saved layouts migrate on load; `useWidgetLayoutStore` loses `update` and gains `change`, `setLayout` and `popOut`, and `StandardOverlays` no longer takes `widgets`. Hero pages draw the Tessera Hero composite and take its slots (`Title`, `Eyebrow`, `Backdrop`, `Art`, `Actions`, `Tools`, `Facts rows`, `Aside`, `Panel`). Migrations `widget-layout-v2` and `hero-slots` turn the old uses into to-dos. The input module draws its devices and calibration with Tessera's PressedGrid, StickPlot and CalibrationPanel, the update dialog and the bug report use Tessera's Small tones, a pref changed in a popped widget reaches the app and is saved with the profile, the main view grip shows only while dragging, and the review checks the dock (no grip at rest), a headless pop-out window (focus, a pref set there kept after the dock back, closing) and the hero slots.
- 9a08468: One copy of React, zustand and Tessera per app build, so component overrides apply the same way in dev and production. The profile card no longer nests buttons, and the review tool checks fonts, the design system loading once and every settings row, and ignores a request that failed once but loaded.
- f62f048: Every app gets a `--review` automation flag: a headless tour of the shell that captures a screenshot per step, checks the title bar, menu, screens, Escape, palette, bug report, About and widgets, and writes a report with exit code 0 or 1. Escape now closes the title bar menu, palette results draw their icons, About rows keep a gap, and `brock start` launches the app folder so the app version applies.
- 38edbcc: The review's watchdog now fires after 30 s with no progress instead of 60 s in total, so a longer tour in a bigger app still finishes.
- ae6b8e2: The shell matches the reference app out of the box: logos, window icon, splashes and the home screen come from the product config, screens and hubs share one framed card, Escape opens home, and the menu has sections, icons, a Dev Console and Credits.
- 14c3674: The splash window is now the only loading screen. It has no frame, border, radius or shadow, a gradient from `product.look` (else the Tessera brand gradient, else the palette seeds through `resolveLook`), the brand mark without its tile, the app name, a status line, a bottom progress bar and the version. The app window stays hidden at its restored bounds until every boot task is done and the home screen has painted, then the two crossfade over 220 ms. Boot tasks are standard: `defineBootTask` in `src/boot/<id>.task.ts` and `electron/boot/<id>.task.ts`, listed by `brock sync` in `.brock/boot.*.ts`, plus module `bootTasks`, run in order with timeouts and weighted progress. A failed task or the watchdog shows the error on the splash with Retry, Open logs and Quit. The boot splash inside `index.html`, `BootProgressBar`, `bootProgress` and `window:shellReady` are gone. `--screenshot-splash=<name>` captures the splash, and the review checks that the splash closed, the app stayed hidden during boot and no loading overlay is left in the app.
- 23907ce: The updater module checks the product's GitHub releases, installs a picked version through Velopack and shows the UpdateDialog, and a main module can run code first in the boot with `onBoot`.

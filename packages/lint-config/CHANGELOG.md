### Minor Changes

- f704655: Guided tours are part of every Brock app, drawn by Tessera's `GuidedTour` and presented by the app's brand mascot. A tour is a file: `src/tours/<id>.tour.ts` default-exports `defineTour({ id, title, steps, trigger? })`. `brock sync`, `brock dev`, `brock build` and the renderer Vite plugin write `.brock/tours.ts`, `BrockApp` takes it as `tours`, and `RendererModule.tours` adds a module's tours. `brock structure` checks the folder, and `brock-lint-config` lets tour files default-export.

  A step lights a Tessera target or a Brock one (`{ shell: 'menu' | 'search' | 'report-bug' | 'title-bar' | 'screen' }`, `{ widget: '<id>' }`, `{ setting: '<key>' }`). Before it shows it can `open` a screen or hub page, open a `widget`, set a `context` and run `before(ctx)`, which may be async. `advanceOn` waits for a click (`{ click: target }`), a tour event (`tours.emit(name)`) or a context change. Each step can name the mascot's state.

  `tours.start(id)`, `tours.stop()`, `tours.next()`, `tours.back()` and `useTour()` drive tours. Completion and the last step are kept per profile in `ui-views.json`, so a finished tour doesn't come back by itself. `trigger: 'first-run'` starts a tour once, the first time a profile opens the app, after the boot and the splash. Menu > Take the tour (in Help when the app has a Help group, else in Advanced) and a search palette action per tour start them. Escape closes a tour, and the other shell shortcuts wait while one is open. The title bar stays usable over the tour. The menu knows a `help` section.

  The review gets a `tours` step: it runs every tour end to end, clicks through interactive steps, captures each step and checks that the tour is kept as completed and that Escape closes it.

  The template ships `welcome.tour.ts`, a four-step first-run tour of the menu, the search, the Notes widget (which waits for a click) and Settings. The 0.27.0 `tour-files` migration adds `tours={appTours}` and its import to `src/main.tsx`.

### Minor Changes

- 70d80cf: Brock moves to Tessera ^0.16.1 and standards ^0.7.0, which Tessera 0.16's lint extension needs. Breaking: `BackTitle` and `BackTitleProps`, `titleBarMenu`, the `focus` option of `confirmAction` and the `ConfirmFocus` type are gone, replaced by Tessera's header Back buttons, title bar dropdowns and danger dialogs; migration `shell-workarounds-removed` lists each use. StackedBar comes from the primitives, the faint text colour is gone from Brock's styles, Brock's stylesheets name no Tessera internals, and the bug report fields take the full dialog width now that Field stops at 512 px.

### Patch Changes

- 70d80cf: The generated `.brock` files are never linted: `brockEslint` ignores `**/.brock/**`, the templates list it, and migration `eslint-brock-ignore` adds it to the ESLint config of the app and of the workspace root.

## 0.17.1

## 0.17.0

### Minor Changes

- 3a35c8e: Apps add their own review steps: each `src/review/<id>.step.ts` (default export `defineReviewStep({ run })`) runs as step `<id>` after the built-in steps, in the same report. `run(tour)` gets the built-in helpers: `check`, `report`, `capture` (named `<id>-<name>`), `find`, `findAll`, `click`, `hover`, `typeText` (inputs and textareas), `press`, `waitFor`, `settle`, `delay`, `openScreen`, `openWidget`, `resetUi`, plus `platform` and `api`. A step that finishes gets a passing `step-ran` check, and an id that is a built-in step's name fails. `brock structure` accepts `<id>.step.ts` files and the lint preset allows their default export. The new app ships `src/review/notes.step.ts`.
- d358df3: A base screen is a file now: `src/screens/<id>.base.tsx`, one per app, default-exports its component (`BaseProps`) with `title` and `icon` in `meta`. `brock sync` lists it, `BrockApp` draws it under every hub, Escape closes down to it and opens `config.home` from it, and `brock structure` rejects a second one, one inside a bucket and one named like a bucket. The `base-screen-file` migration moves a hand `defineScreen` passed through `screens` and `home` into that file, or leaves a to-do naming the file when the screen holds more than a title, an icon and a component.
- e70afc3: An app puts its own items in the title bar without a module: `src/title-bar/<id>.action.ts` default-exports `defineTitleBarItem({ kind: 'button' | 'menu' | 'status', ... })` or a hook that returns one. `brock sync` writes `.brock/title-bar.ts` and `BrockApp` takes it as `titleBar`. A `menu` item opens a dropdown of its own, a `status` item is a tag drawn while its status is set, and every item folds into the main menu when the bar is narrow. App items come after Search, Report a bug and the module items, whose order stays fixed. The `title-bar-files` migration wires `src/main.tsx`.
- 87fa9a3: A default widget layout and Reset layout. `src/widgets/layout.ts` default-exports `defineLayoutPreset({ rows, sizes, widths })`: rows of widget ids around the `main` view, with an array of ids tabbing them in one pane. `brock sync` exports it from `.brock/widgets.ts` as `appWidgetLayout` (undefined without the file), and `src/main.tsx` passes `widgetLayout={appWidgetLayout}` to `BrockApp`. A profile with no saved layout starts from it, and `meta.defaultOpen` opens a widget the preset does not place on its default side. `widgets.reset()` and the new Reset layout entry at the end of the Widgets menu put the layout back to that default. The `widget-layout-prop` migration wires `src/main.tsx`; the template ships a layout with Notes beside the main view.

## 0.16.0

### Minor Changes

- 7ef6122: A tab page takes its meta from `<page>.page.ts` beside its folder: a file that exports only `meta: ScreenMeta` (title, icon, order, shortcut, devOnly, keywords). The screen sync writes it as a `page-meta` entry, the nav and the search index name and place the page with it, and `brock structure` names a `.page.ts` with no tab folder beside it or no `meta` export.

## 0.13.0

## 0.11.0

### Minor Changes

- 54d913a: Widgets by convention, placed like screens: an app's widgets are `src/widgets/<id>.widget.tsx` files whose default export is the component and whose `meta` holds the label, icon, popOut, devOnly, visibility, side and sizes. `brock sync` and the dev server write `.brock/widgets.ts`, and `BrockApp` takes it as the new `widgets` prop; `defineWidget`, `registerWidgets` and module widgets keep working. `brock structure` checks the folder, the lint config lets widget files export `meta` beside their default export, the starter app has a Notes widget, and `brock adopt` gives each app of a workspace its own views and prints where every kind of code goes. The `widget-files` migration wires `src/main.tsx` and lists every hand-made widget as a to-do naming its new file. Brock's own Logs and Performance widgets follow the same layout inside brock-react, and `docs/app-structure.md` maps where every piece of an app goes.

## 0.10.0

## 0.9.0

## 0.8.1

### Patch Changes

- 03dcade: Standards moved to 0.x: Brock depends on `@drizztdourden08/standards` ^0.6.0 and calls its shared workflows at `@v0`. The family never takes a major version; `standards sync --check` now rejects a changeset that asks for one.

## 0.8.0

### Patch Changes

- 98b5318: Take standards 1.0.5, which bans tool and vendor names in prose, strings and identifiers and skips every path git ignores. Every folder that needs ignoring is a dot-folder: the repo, the app template and `brock adopt` ignore them all with `.*/`, with a `!` line per tracked dot-folder. New `brock knip` runs knip with the git-ignored paths, so it works in a worktree inside a dot-folder; the lint and deadcode scripts use it. The thread CLI finds `tools/brock-plugin-*/index.mjs` inside any top-level dot-folder instead of two named folders, and the trailer check rejects co-author lines, "generated with/by" lines and the robot emoji without naming a tool.

### Minor Changes

- 1f2ce71: The rules move to `@drizztdourden08/standards`, and `brock-lint-config` becomes Brock's app preset on top of it, with the same exports: `brockEslint`, `brockStylelint`, `brockMarkdownlint`, the rule sets, `./slop-patterns`, `./slop-line-kind`, `./markdown-rules`, `./file-shape`, `./stylelint-rules/*` and `./tsconfig/*`, so app configs do not change. `brockEslint` is `standardsEslint` with the `react-app` preset and Brock's extension (Tessera names in the raw-control messages, default exports for screens, module entries and boot tasks, Tessera's tokens for `brock/no-token-*`), which the package also declares in `package.json` for discovery. Every source file now needs the `/* @layer <layer> @kind <kind> */` header (`local/file-header`). `typescript-eslint`, `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` and `stylelint-config-standard` are no longer peers: standards carries them.

## 0.1.2

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 068a02d: Screens by convention: files in src/screens become bucket hubs, pages, tabs, settings pages, cards and custom screens through a generated .brock/screens.ts, with the menu, bucket switch, Escape home and settings placement read from screens.config.ts. brock structure checks the layout, the review opens every generated screen, and the template app uses it.
- b1fa12d: Breaking: a full-bleed screen at the root of src/screens is now `<id>.layer.tsx`, and `<page>.custom.tsx` names a custom page inside a bucket; migration custom-layer-rename renames each root `.custom.tsx` and lists it in the report, and knip-custom-pages adds custom pages to the knip entries. Search now reads one index for the palette and every hub: `brock sync` and the dev server write `.brock/search.ts` from the screens, their `meta.keywords`, the settings rows and each custom page's `searchEntries`, without loading any page, and modules, widgets, the menu, actions and `useSearchEntries` join at runtime. Generated hubs have search on, grouped by page, Ctrl+K inside a hub focuses it, a result opens its page and flashes its row, `brock structure` fails a custom page without `searchEntries` and counts them per bucket, and the review searches a sample from each source in the palette and in a hub.
- 14c3674: The splash window is now the only loading screen. It has no frame, border, radius or shadow, a gradient from `product.look` (else the Tessera brand gradient, else the palette seeds through `resolveLook`), the brand mark without its tile, the app name, a status line, a bottom progress bar and the version. The app window stays hidden at its restored bounds until every boot task is done and the home screen has painted, then the two crossfade over 220 ms. Boot tasks are standard: `defineBootTask` in `src/boot/<id>.task.ts` and `electron/boot/<id>.task.ts`, listed by `brock sync` in `.brock/boot.*.ts`, plus module `bootTasks`, run in order with timeouts and weighted progress. A failed task or the watchdog shows the error on the splash with Retry, Open logs and Quit. The boot splash inside `index.html`, `BootProgressBar`, `bootProgress` and `window:shellReady` are gone. `--screenshot-splash=<name>` captures the splash, and the review checks that the splash closed, the app stayed hidden during boot and no loading overlay is left in the app.

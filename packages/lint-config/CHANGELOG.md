## 0.12.0

## 0.11.0

### Minor Changes

- 54d913a: Widgets by convention, placed like screens: an app's widgets are `src/widgets/<id>.widget.tsx` files whose default export is the component and whose `meta` holds the label, icon, popOut, devOnly, visibility, side and sizes. `brock sync` and the dev server write `.brock/widgets.ts`, and `BrockApp` takes it as the new `widgets` prop; `defineWidget`, `registerWidgets` and module widgets keep working. `brock structure` checks the folder, the lint config lets widget files export `meta` beside their default export, the starter app has a Notes widget, and `brock adopt` gives each app of a workspace its own views and prints where every kind of code goes. The `widget-files` migration wires `src/main.tsx` and lists every hand-made widget as a to-do naming its new file. Brock's own Logs and Performance widgets follow the same layout inside brock-react, and `docs/app-structure.md` maps where every piece of an app goes.

## 0.8.1

### Patch Changes

- 03dcade: Standards moved to 0.x: Brock depends on `@drizztdourden08/standards` ^0.6.0 and calls its shared workflows at `@v0`. The family never takes a major version; `standards sync --check` now rejects a changeset that asks for one.

## 0.8.0

### Patch Changes

- 98b5318: Take standards 1.0.5, which bans tool and vendor names in prose, strings and identifiers and skips every path git ignores. Every folder that needs ignoring is a dot-folder: the repo, the app template and `brock adopt` ignore them all with `.*/`, with a `!` line per tracked dot-folder. New `brock knip` runs knip with the git-ignored paths, so it works in a worktree inside a dot-folder; the lint and deadcode scripts use it. The thread CLI finds `tools/brock-plugin-*/index.mjs` inside any top-level dot-folder instead of two named folders, and the trailer check rejects co-author lines, "generated with/by" lines and the robot emoji without naming a tool.

### Minor Changes

- 1f2ce71: The rules move to `@drizztdourden08/standards`, and `brock-lint-config` becomes Brock's app preset on top of it, with the same exports: `brockEslint`, `brockStylelint`, `brockMarkdownlint`, the rule sets, `./slop-patterns`, `./slop-line-kind`, `./markdown-rules`, `./file-shape`, `./stylelint-rules/*` and `./tsconfig/*`, so app configs do not change. `brockEslint` is `standardsEslint` with the `react-app` preset and Brock's extension (Tessera names in the raw-control messages, default exports for screens, module entries and boot tasks, Tessera's tokens for `brock/no-token-*`), which the package also declares in `package.json` for discovery. Every source file now needs the `/* @layer <layer> @kind <kind> */` header (`local/file-header`). `typescript-eslint`, `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` and `stylelint-config-standard` are no longer peers: standards carries them.

## 0.1.2

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 068a02d: Screens by convention: files in src/screens become bucket hubs, pages, tabs, settings pages, cards and custom screens through a generated .brock/screens.ts, with the menu, bucket switch, Escape home and settings placement read from screens.config.ts. brock structure checks the layout, the review opens every generated screen, and the template app uses it.
- b1fa12d: Breaking: a full-bleed screen at the root of src/screens is now `<id>.layer.tsx`, and `<page>.custom.tsx` names a custom page inside a bucket; migration custom-layer-rename renames each root `.custom.tsx` and lists it in the report, and knip-custom-pages adds custom pages to the knip entries. Search now reads one index for the palette and every hub: `brock sync` and the dev server write `.brock/search.ts` from the screens, their `meta.keywords`, the settings rows and each custom page's `searchEntries`, without loading any page, and modules, widgets, the menu, actions and `useSearchEntries` join at runtime. Generated hubs have search on, grouped by page, Ctrl+K inside a hub focuses it, a result opens its page and flashes its row, `brock structure` fails a custom page without `searchEntries` and counts them per bucket, and the review searches a sample from each source in the palette and in a hub.
- 14c3674: The splash window is now the only loading screen. It has no frame, border, radius or shadow, a gradient from `product.look` (else the Tessera brand gradient, else the palette seeds through `resolveLook`), the brand mark without its tile, the app name, a status line, a bottom progress bar and the version. The app window stays hidden at its restored bounds until every boot task is done and the home screen has painted, then the two crossfade over 220 ms. Boot tasks are standard: `defineBootTask` in `src/boot/<id>.task.ts` and `electron/boot/<id>.task.ts`, listed by `brock sync` in `.brock/boot.*.ts`, plus module `bootTasks`, run in order with timeouts and weighted progress. A failed task or the watchdog shows the error on the splash with Retry, Open logs and Quit. The boot splash inside `index.html`, `BootProgressBar`, `bootProgress` and `window:shellReady` are gone. `--screenshot-splash=<name>` captures the splash, and the review checks that the splash closed, the app stayed hidden during boot and no loading overlay is left in the app.

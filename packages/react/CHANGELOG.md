## 0.13.0

### Minor Changes

- 33dc33c: Snap clusters replace manual window groups.

  - Every window joined by snap links, directly or through other windows, the main window included, is one cluster, computed from the live links. Dragging any window of a cluster moves the whole cluster rigidly; only the dragged window snaps, to windows outside the cluster, and what it is dropped against joins the cluster. Holding Ctrl while moving drags one window alone: it leaves the cluster, its links break (a window linked to it relinks to another window it is still flush with) and it can snap elsewhere. A window with no link moves alone as before.
  - Maximize, full screen with the black backdrop, minimize and restore act on the cluster, with the same fit and pack maths and the same restore. Closing a widget closes that widget alone. Resizing keeps the session rules and never moves a cluster.
  - Manual groups are gone: the `group` field of the popped layout, `WidgetWindowState` and the probe facts, `WidgetWindowGroup`, `widget:setGroup`, `widget:setMainGroup`, `widget:getMainGroup` and `widget:mainGroup`, the "Window group" wiring of `WidgetOptions` and `WindowTitleBar` (Brock no longer passes those props), and `config/window-group.json`, which main deletes at start. A `group` left in a saved popped entry is dropped when the layout loads, and the `drop-window-groups` upgrade step cleans the dev data under `.user-data`. `WidgetWindowSummary.group` becomes `cluster`, the number of windows in the cluster, and the probe's `group` request becomes `cluster`.
  - The window guide shows in the window being moved or resized, a widget window or the main window, instead of always in main: `widget:guide` goes to that window only. Its hints follow the new rules: snapped windows move together, Ctrl moves one window alone, flush windows resize together, Ctrl resizes one window alone without snapping.
  - A resize now moves every window on the dragged line: two widgets stacked against main's left edge both follow main's edge, and either widget's right edge moves main's edge and the other widget's; a window stacked end to end on the far side of the line follows too.
  - The review checks a cluster moving together and with main, a Ctrl move detaching, cluster maximize, restore and full screen, the guide drawn in the moved window and in main, and the stacked seam.

- 4711645: Brock takes Tessera 0.14.0 (peer range `^0.14.0`): nested sub-menus, checks and radios that keep the menu open, lists correct under zoom, palettes in their own cascade layer, and the Island Spirit Pelago. No Brock code changes.

## 0.12.0

### Minor Changes

- f751683: The product brand's mascot joins search: Flint for `brock`, Pelago for `archipelia` and Sentri for `rotp` sit in the command palette's input row and in every hub search, looking around before you type and jumping up when nothing matches. A brand without a mascot, or no brand, keeps the plain search icon. The review checks the mascot in the palette and in the hub search, and captures the hub search before typing and with no match.
- f751683: Brock moves to Tessera 0.12.0 (brock-react's peer is `^0.12.0`). A widget window now draws Tessera's own pin menu in its title bar and Tessera's Pin row in its options panel, in place of Brock's `WidgetPinMenu` and the Stacking row; the pin stays off or on top, sync stays a separate option, and a saved `with-app` pin still opens as off with sync on. The `widget:popped` event carries the new `PoppedWidgetPatch`, whose pin is never `with-app`. The review reads the page header through the `content-header` classes.
- 59c1c9d: Brock moves to Tessera 0.13.0 (brock-react's peer is `^0.13.0`).

  - Palettes: `BrockApp` imports Tessera's brand palettes into the `ds.palette` layer and sets `data-palette` on the document root to `product.icons.brand`, in the main window and in popped widget windows. The starter `src/theme.css` sets no seeds and only overrides; the `brock-palette` upgrade step turns an untouched starter theme (the old blue or the Brock seeds) into that override-only file and keeps a theme the app changed. The splash, the look and the installer read the brand palette while `theme.css` sets no seeds.
  - Breaking for hero homes: `Art` takes a `kind` (`image` or `node`), `Backdrop` takes Tessera's `HeroBackdrop` (`node`, `image`, `color`) or `kind: 'none'`, and the new `Shade` slot takes `value`. The `hero-kinds` upgrade step adds `kind="image"` to art and turns a `Backdrop` with children into a to-do.
  - About has no page header, as Tessera's InfoScreen now draws none; the screen declares the new `header: 'none'` and the review checks that no header shows.
  - The search mascot comes from Tessera's `mascotForBrand`; Brock's own brand to mascot table is gone.

## 0.11.0

### Minor Changes

- 48ca303: A built-in Performance widget every app gets, closed by default and listed in the Widgets menu: the renderer (frame rate and frame time, long tasks, event loop lag, JS heap, DOM nodes), every process from main (CPU and memory per process, main process memory, uptime, windows and widget windows with their sync and group, IPC calls per second, runtime versions, GPU compositing) and the app state (version, screen and route, profile, open widgets, modules, errors and warnings since start). Its options set the refresh and the sections shown, sampling stops while it is off screen, and Copy snapshot puts the numbers on the clipboard for a bug report. The new `diagnostics:getProcesses` channel (`getProcessDiagnostics`) feeds it, and the review opens it and checks the numbers move.
- 54d913a: Widgets by convention, placed like screens: an app's widgets are `src/widgets/<id>.widget.tsx` files whose default export is the component and whose `meta` holds the label, icon, popOut, devOnly, visibility, side and sizes. `brock sync` and the dev server write `.brock/widgets.ts`, and `BrockApp` takes it as the new `widgets` prop; `defineWidget`, `registerWidgets` and module widgets keep working. `brock structure` checks the folder, the lint config lets widget files export `meta` beside their default export, the starter app has a Notes widget, and `brock adopt` gives each app of a workspace its own views and prints where every kind of code goes. The `widget-files` migration wires `src/main.tsx` and lists every hand-made widget as a to-do naming its new file. Brock's own Logs and Performance widgets follow the same layout inside brock-react, and `docs/app-structure.md` maps where every piece of an app goes.

  - @drizztdourden08/brock-core@0.11.0

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- a265770: Every screen shows Tessera's page header with an icon and a title.

  - Breaking: `ScreenDef.icon`, `HubDef.icon` and `HubPage.icon` are required, and `ScreenLayer` takes a required `icon`. Every built-in screen has one: Profiles, Settings, About, Credits and the input tester.
  - A fullscreen screen's content sits in Tessera's `ScreenPage` inside the `ScreenLayer` card, with the screen icon and title. `header: 'own'` leaves the content to draw its own headers; hubs and the settings screen use it. Each hub page draws under its own header: settings pages in `SettingsPage` with their anchors, a settings tab that renders itself in `SettingsPage` too, and every other page in `ScreenPage`. `HubPage.fullBleed` keeps a page such as a bucket's hero home filling the pane.
  - The About screen passes the app name as the `InfoScreen` heading and an info icon.
  - The `screen-icons` migration (0.10.0) leaves a to-do on each `defineScreen` or `defineHub` call without an icon.
  - The review checks the page header, its icon and its title on every screen and every hub page that has one.

- a265770: Every settings row has a description and a hint, as in Tessera 0.10.0.

  - Breaking: a settings item is `{ key, label, hint, description | noDescription: true, keywords?, link?, control? }`, the same shape as Tessera's `SettingsItem`. The typecheck fails on an item without a `hint`, or without a `description` or an explicit `noDescription: true`. `SettingDescription` and `SettingItemFields` are exported, and a `choice` option takes its own `hint`.
  - Each item draws as a Tessera `SettingsRow`: the description under the title at rest, and the hint in its place while the control is pointed at or focused. A custom control from `renderControl` stays a content row, and a boolean item with a `link` stays a toggle with the link. `DefaultControl` is gone.
  - Search finds hints: the hub search matches the hint and each option's label and hint, the palette scores the hint like the description, and the build-time search seeds read `hint` from `.settings.ts` pages.
  - Every built-in row has a real description and hint: the template's General page, the display module's window and refresh rate rows, the updater dialog's pre-release and version rows, and the input module's dead zone sliders, which are now settings rows.
  - The `settings-row-hints` migration (0.10.0) leaves a to-do on each app settings row, in a `.settings.ts` page, a settings tab or a Tessera `SettingsSection`, that lacks a hint or a description, naming the missing fields.
  - The review points at a settings row on each settings page, checks that its hint replaces the description, and captures it.

- a265770: Brock takes Tessera 0.10.0. The catalog and the brock-react peer move to `^0.10.0`.

  - `brock migrate` replays the new `configKeys` group of Tessera's `RENAMES.json`: dotted setting paths moved inside JSON files a project keeps, by file name, where `*` stands for any one key such as an app folder. The step edits `tessera.config.json` and `package.json` at the app root, the repo root and every workspace package in place. A key whose parent stays the same is renamed where it stands, an object whose every key moves to the same new sibling is renamed whole, and any other key is cut and pasted at the indentation of its new place, with an emptied parent removed. Order, layout and indentation are kept, a second run changes nothing, and a target that is already set is never overwritten: it becomes a to-do. For Tessera 0.10.0 that moves the usage settings object to `guide`, at the top level and under each `apps` entry, and the `package.json` guide script to `guide`.
  - Brock's own `tessera.config.json` holds `guide`, and the prose exception for the old key is gone.

- a265770: Tessera 0.10.0 draws the widget window controls, so Brock's interim pieces are gone.

  - The popped options panel passes `sync`, `onSyncChange`, `group`, `groups` and `onGroupChange` to Tessera's `WidgetOptions`, which draws the "Sync with main window" switch and the "Window group" select with their tooltips and hints. `WindowGroupControls` is removed.
  - The app window shows Tessera's `WindowGuideOverlay` while a widget window moves or resizes. Brock's own overlay is removed.
  - The app title bar passes `windowGroup`, `windowGroups` and `onWindowGroupChange` to `WindowTitleBar`, so the View sub-menu has a Window group radio sub-menu. The cycling "Window group" title bar action and `useWindowGroupTitleAction` are removed.
  - A full screen window group sets Tessera's `square` on the open screen's `ScreenLayer` and on the widget window's `Widget`, in place of the `brock-app--square` and `widget-window--square` classes.
  - Brock keeps its own pin menu and "Stacking" row until Tessera reworks its pin button.
  - The review reads the new markup: the guide by `.window-guide--open`, its mode and its snapping line, the square chrome on an open screen, and the View > Window group sub-menu, with a capture of it. It also captures the popped widget options with the sync and group rows.

### Patch Changes

- @drizztdourden08/brock-core@0.10.0

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- 28540bb: Widget windows: a direct pin choice, and resizing snapped windows moves only the dragged edge.

  - The pin is now `off` or `top`. The old `with-app` pin did what "Sync with main window" does, so the two are merged: a synced window also mirrors the app's always-on-top. `WidgetPinMode` drops `with-app`; the new `StoredPinMode` keeps it for saved popped entries, and a saved `with-app` pin opens as `off` with `sync` on and is written back to the layout.
  - The widget window bar shows Brock's `WidgetPinMenu` in place of Tessera's cycling pin button: a pin-off icon for a normal window, a highlighted pin and an "On top" label while pinned, and a menu listing both states with a hint and a check on the current one. The options panel has a "Stacking" row with the same two choices.
  - Resizing a widget window moves only the dragged edge, with edge snapping. The windows exactly flush against that edge have their facing edge moved with it, and nothing else changes size. Before, a neighbour whose own edge only lined up with the dragged one (the tops of two windows side by side) was stretched with it. Ctrl still resizes the window alone.
  - The main window's aspect lock applies to the main window alone. It used to be hooked onto every window created, widget windows included. The widget resize pipeline (`planResize`) now keeps the main window in proportion and never lets a widget's shared edge bend it.
  - The review's widget-windows step checks both pin states and captures the bar while pinned. It also resizes a snapped window from its outer edge and from the shared edge, and asserts the neighbour keeps its size apart from that edge.

- @drizztdourden08/brock-core@0.8.1

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- dcdde4a: Widget windows sync with the main window, snap into a grid and act in groups. A popped window is now synced by default: on Windows the app window owns it, so it no longer falls behind other apps when the focus goes elsewhere, and it shows, hides, minimizes, restores and raises with the app. A per-widget "Sync with main window" switch makes it independent with its own taskbar entry. Moving snaps corners and edges, resizing snaps the moving edge to the neighbours' edges, and an edge shared by snapped windows resizes them all together; Ctrl skips snapping and resizes one window. The app and each widget can join a window group (1 to 4) whose members maximize, go full screen over a black backdrop with square corners, minimize, restore and close together. The app window shows a guide with the shortcuts while a widget window moves or resizes. Brock draws interim controls (`WindowGroupControls`, a "Window group" title bar action, `WindowGuideOverlay`) until Tessera ships its own. The `widget:*` contract gains `setSync`, `setGroup`, `setMainGroup`, `getMainGroup`, `mainGroup`, `guide` and `square`, and the window state carries `sync`, `group` and `square`.

## 0.7.1

### Patch Changes

- e0ea131: Brock takes Tessera 0.9.1: a Button leaving its loading state shows its label at once, so the About "Copy debug info" button is no longer blank in background windows and review captures.
  - @drizztdourden08/brock-core@0.7.1

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- f6cfba5: Brock takes Tessera 0.8.0 and its rimmed logos. `product.icons.rim` (`'light'` or `'dark'`) picks Tessera's `brand/<rim>-rim/<brand>/` set, and it defaults to `'light'` for the `brock` brand, so the mark reads on dark surfaces. `brock icons`, the splash mark, the bot variant, the installer and Setup splash mark read from that tree. `brock icons` also copies `icon-32.png` and `icon-24.png` to `public/logos/`, and with a brand `product.logos.app` defaults to `./logos/icon-32.png`, so the title bar no longer scales a 256 px icon down to 20 px and loses the rim. A copied file is skipped only when it holds the same bytes, so a rim switch recopies the set. The About panel draws a rimmed brand as its bare mark. Migration `gitignore-title-bar-logos` ignores the two new logo files.
- 6d32d18: Brock takes Tessera 0.9.0 (peer range `^0.9.0`): the slim side-nav scrollbar and typed InputIcon names, with no code changes in Brock.
- f6cfba5: Breaking: `RendererModule.titleBar` and `TitleBarSlot` are gone, and `STANDARD_TITLE_BAR_SLOTS` is now `STANDARD_TITLE_BAR_ACTIONS`. Tessera 0.8.0's `WindowTitleBar` takes `actions`, so a module lists `titleBarActions`: each a `WindowTitleBarAction` or a hook that returns one. Search (Ctrl+K) and Report a bug are standard actions, and the updater contributes `useUpdateAction`, a status pill reading "Update available" while an update waits. Every action is also in the hamburger, beside a View sub-menu with the pin and full screen, and an action replaces the menu entry of the same key there; Quit sits in its own group below them. The review checks the bar items, the menu actions and the View sub-menu. Migration `title-bar-actions` rewrites the updater badge and the standard buttons and leaves a to-do for any other slot.

## 0.6.1

### Patch Changes

- 227dadf: Brock takes Tessera 0.7.1: the hero title fits its column, and the logs widget uses Tessera's own "1 entry" / "n entries" count instead of Brock's workaround.
  - @drizztdourden08/brock-core@0.6.1

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 0d9b68a: Brock moves onto Tessera 0.7.0. Hubs and settings hubs sit on `SideNavLayout`, a settings page draws one `SettingsSection` per section (with its own empty message), and hub search hits show their path and description. The logs widget hands `LogPanel` the whole log and keeps its type filter as a widget pref (`filters`, a list of filter clauses, in place of `hiddenLevels`). `ProfilesPanel` rows pass their aside as an end column. Popped widget windows follow Tessera's `visibleLayoutOf` gates, and `onPopOut` takes Tessera's `ScreenPoint`. The input tester and `CalibrationPanel` draw controller glyphs with Tessera's `InputIcon`: `CalibrationPanel` takes `family`, and `inputFamilyOf(vendorId)` picks Xbox, PlayStation, Switch or generic. The display settings tab lets its sections keep Tessera's spacing. Brock's root `tessera.config.json` sets `layer: renderer-shell` and an app tree for the panels Tessera handed over.

### Patch Changes

- @drizztdourden08/brock-core@0.6.0

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 241d164: Widget windows work end to end. A linked window is towed by the edge it sits on, so resizing the app from any side keeps it flush, and maximize or fullscreen hides the windows linked to the app until it is back to normal. Towed moves report their bounds, pending reports are flushed when the app closes or quits, and links survive a restart. The app snaps to widget windows with the same 14 px rule and links the one it lands against. A window lost after a display change comes back into a work area; a plain drag is left to the OS and no snap fights a move across displays of another scale. The `devOnly`, context-only and `show` gates close and reopen popped widgets, which keep their place. A drag-out opens the window at the release point: `onPopOut(id, point?: ScreenPoint)` is accepted ahead of Tessera 0.7.0, with the cursor as the fallback. Drop-in turns the window translucent over the app, ignores a drop where another widget window covers the app, and no longer loses a release between two renders; dock-backs carry a sequence number, Alt+F4 closes the widget, widget windows stay off the taskbar unless a definition sets `taskbar: true`, and followers come back without taking the focus. Widget windows get the active profile and the settings, with changes sent back to the app, and the log arrives as increments. The review drives all of it in a new `widget-windows` step.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [ff027d0]
  - @drizztdourden08/brock-core@0.5.0

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- f90c7ee: AboutPanel, ReleaseNotesPanel and CalibrationPanel are Brock compounds now, with ProfilesPanel replacing Tessera's ProfilePicker: brock-react exports `AboutPanel`, `ReleaseNotesPanel` and `ProfilesPanel`, and `@drizztdourden08/brock-input/renderer` exports `CalibrationPanel`, each with its props types and a Tessera usage file. The About screen sits in Tessera's `InfoScreen`, the Profiles screen can rename a profile in its row (`useProfiles().rename`), the input tester shows the buttons held while it calibrates, and the updater dialog draws brock-react's `ReleaseNotesPanel`.
- babbff5: Brock takes Tessera 0.6.0 (peer range `^0.6.0`); Brock uses neither the renamed numeric Stepper nor Emphasis, so no code changes. Standards is at ^1.0.3.

### Patch Changes

- @drizztdourden08/brock-core@0.4.0

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- dde5d7e: Brock takes Tessera 0.5.0 (peer range `^0.5.0`): screens sit in Tessera's ScreenWindow (the former FullScreenLayer, classes `screen-layer*` and `screen-window__*`), and the title-bar search button draws the twinkling search icon in place of the removed SearchSpark. Brock's own code was moved with `brock migrate --tessera-from 0.4.0`.

### Patch Changes

- @drizztdourden08/brock-core@0.3.0

## 0.2.0

### Patch Changes

- Brock takes Tessera 0.4.0: SectionNav is SideNav and HeaderTabs is HeaderAnchorNav (replayed with Brock's own Tessera renames step), the title bar menu, the fixed-head search results and the config loader are the published ones.

  New apps' knip ignores `@drizztdourden08/standards`, whose stylelint plugins it sees through brock-lint-config; the `standards-lint-deps` upgrade step does the same for an existing app and drops `typescript-eslint` and `eslint-plugin-react-hooks`, which standards now carries.

- f818087: Breaking: Brock moves to the next Tessera. The title bar menu is Tessera's hamburger `DropdownMenu`, built from `MenuGroup[]` by `toMenuGroups` in place of `toDropdownItems`, and a bucket or page `shortcut` shows beside its entry. `product.window.titleBar.controls` turns the fullscreen, pin, minimize and maximize buttons off; maximize and fullscreen off also make the main window not maximizable or fullscreenable. About shows the Tessera brand icon and wordmark when the product is that brand, the copy buttons write through `TesseraProvider` `overrides.writeText`, Hero facts take `FactsPanelGroup[]`, and the input module's device badges are `Status`. Migrations `progress-bar-tone` and `facts-panel-names` rewrite app code; `badge-status`, `tessera-provider-overrides`, `window-title-bar-config` and `dropdown-menu-groups` leave to-dos.
- 374cf2f: `upgrade` moves the app's Tessera to the range brock-react asks for (its catalog entry or plain spec; a linked Tessera is left alone), so an app upgraded across a Tessera release installs the Tessera its new Brock was built on. brock-react's Tessera peer range is `^0.4.0`.
- Updated dependencies [f818087]

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- db1a6be: A hub search shows a settings page's matching rows live, under their section titles and editable in place, as rotp's profile hub does, instead of links. Other pages keep link hits; pages whose name matches are offered as jumps. The review checks the live row, its control and the group heading.
- f60b232: `product.widgets.mainLabel` in `brock.config.ts` names the main view in the widget dock (default `Main`). The saved layout key stays `main`.

  - @drizztdourden08/brock-core@0.1.2

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 0a52cd7: The gaps the first Archipelia app found, now in Brock. `product.ports` gives each app a port block, each thread worktree a slot of its own and the dev server `strictPort`; `create-brock` writes the base. `brock adopt` writes the knip entries and the `.gitignore` lines for generated outputs. `brock check` and `brock sync` run per app at a workspace root. `launchAppForTest` from `brock-build/testing` starts the built app headless for app e2e tests. New helpers: `confirmAction`, `useNow`, `useCopyText`, `useKeyedGuard`, `redactSecrets` and `lanAddresses()` with the `network:lanAddresses` channel.
- ade72f8: Breaking: the widget host moves to the Tessera WidgetManager v2 on DockLayout. Widgets dock in a split tree around the main view (the home or game view), float over it, or open in a window of their own when their definition sets `popOut: true`, with pin, snap, towing and drag back in handled by brock-electron over the new `widget:*` channels of brock-core. The layout is `{ v: 2, dock, floating, popped, frame }` and saved layouts migrate on load; `useWidgetLayoutStore` loses `update` and gains `change`, `setLayout` and `popOut`, and `StandardOverlays` no longer takes `widgets`. Hero pages draw the Tessera Hero composite and take its slots (`Title`, `Eyebrow`, `Backdrop`, `Art`, `Actions`, `Tools`, `Facts rows`, `Aside`, `Panel`). Migrations `widget-layout-v2` and `hero-slots` turn the old uses into to-dos. The input module draws its devices and calibration with Tessera's PressedGrid, StickPlot and CalibrationPanel, the update dialog and the bug report use Tessera's Small tones, a pref changed in a popped widget reaches the app and is saved with the profile, the main view grip shows only while dragging, and the review checks the dock (no grip at rest), a headless pop-out window (focus, a pref set there kept after the dock back, closing) and the hero slots.
- 9a08468: One copy of React, zustand and Tessera per app build, so component overrides apply the same way in dev and production. The profile card no longer nests buttons, and the review tool checks fonts, the design system loading once and every settings row, and ignores a request that failed once but loaded.
- f62f048: Every app gets a `--review` automation flag: a headless tour of the shell that captures a screenshot per step, checks the title bar, menu, screens, Escape, palette, bug report, About and widgets, and writes a report with exit code 0 or 1. Escape now closes the title bar menu, palette results draw their icons, About rows keep a gap, and `brock start` launches the app folder so the app version applies.
- 068a02d: Screens by convention: files in src/screens become bucket hubs, pages, tabs, settings pages, cards and custom screens through a generated .brock/screens.ts, with the menu, bucket switch, Escape home and settings placement read from screens.config.ts. brock structure checks the layout, the review opens every generated screen, and the template app uses it.
- b1fa12d: Breaking: a full-bleed screen at the root of src/screens is now `<id>.layer.tsx`, and `<page>.custom.tsx` names a custom page inside a bucket; migration custom-layer-rename renames each root `.custom.tsx` and lists it in the report, and knip-custom-pages adds custom pages to the knip entries. Search now reads one index for the palette and every hub: `brock sync` and the dev server write `.brock/search.ts` from the screens, their `meta.keywords`, the settings rows and each custom page's `searchEntries`, without loading any page, and modules, widgets, the menu, actions and `useSearchEntries` join at runtime. Generated hubs have search on, grouped by page, Ctrl+K inside a hub focuses it, a result opens its page and flashes its row, `brock structure` fails a custom page without `searchEntries` and counts them per bucket, and the review searches a sample from each source in the palette and in a hub.
- ae6b8e2: The shell matches the reference app out of the box: logos, window icon, splashes and the home screen come from the product config, screens and hubs share one framed card, Escape opens home, and the menu has sections, icons, a Dev Console and Credits.
- 14c3674: The splash window is now the only loading screen. It has no frame, border, radius or shadow, a gradient from `product.look` (else the Tessera brand gradient, else the palette seeds through `resolveLook`), the brand mark without its tile, the app name, a status line, a bottom progress bar and the version. The app window stays hidden at its restored bounds until every boot task is done and the home screen has painted, then the two crossfade over 220 ms. Boot tasks are standard: `defineBootTask` in `src/boot/<id>.task.ts` and `electron/boot/<id>.task.ts`, listed by `brock sync` in `.brock/boot.*.ts`, plus module `bootTasks`, run in order with timeouts and weighted progress. A failed task or the watchdog shows the error on the splash with Retry, Open logs and Quit. The boot splash inside `index.html`, `BootProgressBar`, `bootProgress` and `window:shellReady` are gone. `--screenshot-splash=<name>` captures the splash, and the review checks that the splash closed, the app stayed hidden during boot and no loading overlay is left in the app.
- 7e039b6: Every app gets a Ctrl+K search palette with an action API, a bug report dialog that opens a prefilled GitHub issue with diagnostics attached, a fuller About, toasts, and a widget host with a built-in logs widget kept per profile.
- 9fdc2e1: Brock builds on Tessera 0.2.0, which brings the brand gradients, resolved tokens and transparent marks the splash and installer read.
- d50bd75: Every visual part of the shell is now a Tessera composite and Brock keeps only the wiring. The title bar is `WindowTitleBar`, the search palette is `CommandPalette` behind `PaletteHost`, About is `AboutPanel`, the profiles screen is `ProfilePicker` with `InlineCreateForm`, the screen rail is `SectionNav` in its rail variant, hubs and the settings hub sit in `NavLayout` with `SearchResults`, and settings pages are Tessera's `SettingsPage` with `SettingsGroupList`. The bug report button takes the `IconButton` danger tone, the diagnostics preview is a `CodeBlock`, the logs widget colours warnings and errors through `LogKindDef` tones, and the updater dialog uses `ReleaseNotesPanel` and `Callout`.

  Removed exports: `TitleBar`, `WindowControls`, `InstanceBadge`, `About`, `ProfileCard`, `CreateProfileForm`, `ScreenRail`, `SettingsPage`, `SearchPalette` and `partitionByLock`; use the Tessera composites in their place. `useProfiles` gains `removeConfirmed`, which deletes without the confirm dialog. The search flash class is now `search-hit`.

  Breaking: the removed shell exports ship the `removed-shell-exports` migration, which turns each import into a to-do naming its Tessera composite.

- a8a87be: Apps update and ship the way Relic of the Past does. The update dialog no longer opens by itself: a found update shows as a badge on a version tag in the title bar, which modules reach through the new `RendererModule.titleBar` slot. `brock package` builds the app tree, the Windows installer with the app icon and a splash, and the Velopack update packages. `create-brock` and `brock adopt` write a release workflow that packages every platform and publishes to GitHub Releases with `release-notes/v<version>.md` as the body, and `brock release` dispatches it.
- e2cf0ee: Every new app starts with the updater: create-brock records it and adds the module and its velopack peer in registry and local link mode. The title bar drops the permanent version tag and shows an "Update available" badge only when an update is found, the update dialog follows the reference layout and says plainly when the app has no update source, and the review tool checks the menu entry, the dialog and its Escape.

## 0.8.1

### Patch Changes

- 03dcade: Standards moved to 0.x: Brock depends on `@drizztdourden08/standards` ^0.6.0 and calls its shared workflows at `@v0`. The family never takes a major version; `standards sync --check` now rejects a changeset that asks for one.

## 0.8.0

### Patch Changes

- 98b5318: Take standards 1.0.5, which bans tool and vendor names in prose, strings and identifiers and skips every path git ignores. Every folder that needs ignoring is a dot-folder: the repo, the app template and `brock adopt` ignore them all with `.*/`, with a `!` line per tracked dot-folder. New `brock knip` runs knip with the git-ignored paths, so it works in a worktree inside a dot-folder; the lint and deadcode scripts use it. The thread CLI finds `tools/brock-plugin-*/index.mjs` inside any top-level dot-folder instead of two named folders, and the trailer check rejects co-author lines, "generated with/by" lines and the robot emoji without naming a tool.

### Minor Changes

- e19834d: `brock migrate` replays Tessera's `RENAMES.json` after the Brock migrations: each release after `--tessera-from` (new), else `package.json#brock.tessera` (new pin), else 0.3.0, up to the installed Tessera, plus `next` when Tessera is linked to main; then it pins `brock.tessera` to the installed version. `brock migrate --tessera-from <version>` alone replays only the renames. Custom properties are renamed as whole tokens, components only where a file imports them from Tessera (the import, JSX tags and references), classes in class lists and selectors with a name boundary and longer keys first, props and prop values on the Tessera component's JSX, and literals typed with a renamed Tessera type. A value that is a note, a removed export, and a longer class built from a renamed one become numbered to-dos in the migration report; an entry whose value is also a key of its release is skipped with a warning, so a second replay changes nothing. `brock upgrade` passes the Tessera version the worktree had before its install as `--tessera-from` when the app has no pin yet.

### Patch Changes

- 1f2ce71: `brock structure` and `brock prose` run the checks of `@drizztdourden08/standards`, with Brock's extension in `brock-build/standards.extension.mjs`: `brock.config.ts` marks an app, `build/installer` and `src/screens` keep their own checks, `<id>.task.ts` is a module file. Installing `brock-build` is enough for `standards structure` to load it. Breaking: the `brock.designSystem` flag is gone; list `@drizztdourden08/standards/extensions/usage-files` in `standards.config.mjs` instead. `brock adopt` and `create-brock` take `.npmrc`, `.jscpd.json` and the knip schema from the standards templates, and the generated `eslint.config.mjs` names the `react-app` preset. `brock-thread` checks PR text with the shared writing lists from standards.
- 374cf2f: `upgrade` moves the app's Tessera to the range brock-react asks for (its catalog entry or plain spec; a linked Tessera is left alone), so an app upgraded across a Tessera release installs the Tessera its new Brock was built on. brock-react's Tessera peer range is `^0.4.0`.

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- @drizztdourden08/brock-lint-config@0.1.2

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 0a52cd7: The gaps the first Archipelia app found, now in Brock. `product.ports` gives each app a port block, each thread worktree a slot of its own and the dev server `strictPort`; `create-brock` writes the base. `brock adopt` writes the knip entries and the `.gitignore` lines for generated outputs. `brock check` and `brock sync` run per app at a workspace root. `launchAppForTest` from `brock-build/testing` starts the built app headless for app e2e tests. New helpers: `confirmAction`, `useNow`, `useCopyText`, `useKeyedGuard`, `redactSecrets` and `lanAddresses()` with the `network:lanAddresses` channel.
- 568c900: An app on another Windows drive than its linked Brock checkout keeps its links: `create-brock --local`, `brock add --local`, `brock adopt --local` and `upgrade --local` add `prefer-frozen-lockfile=false` to `.npmrc` (and `pnpm-lock.yaml text eol=lf` to `.gitattributes`) when a `link:` spec crosses drives, so later installs resolve the links instead of joining `X:/...` to the app folder.
- f6a334e: A scaffolded app is a git repository with its first commit, `launch main` runs the main checkout, and the closing steps name the app's own command.
- 8dec315: `launch` refreshes the app's brand logos first, so a fresh worktree reviews clean, and `worktree remove` retries a directory Windows still holds, like `finish`.
- 8498845: Platforms are separate ids (windows, macos, linux, android, web, with ios reserved) and bundles (desktop, mobile) in `targets`. Each one is a strategy with doctor checks, scaffold steps, CI and release jobs and secrets. `brock sync` composes `ci.yml` (lint, structure, tests and the headless review on Linux) and `release.yml` from them. create-brock asks for the platforms or takes `--platforms`; `platform add`, `remove` and `list`, `doctor` and `web build` are new commands. Android gets a Capacitor project in `mobile/android` with signing from the environment, `mobile build --release` and `mobile keystore`; Linux debs install module udev rules.
- d78f430: The release verb's source is tracked in the repo; the ignore rule for installer output no longer matches it.
- a8a87be: Apps update and ship the way Relic of the Past does. The update dialog no longer opens by itself: a found update shows as a badge on a version tag in the title bar, which modules reach through the new `RendererModule.titleBar` slot. `brock package` builds the app tree, the Windows installer with the app icon and a splash, and the Velopack update packages. `create-brock` and `brock adopt` write a release workflow that packages every platform and publishes to GitHub Releases with `release-notes/v<version>.md` as the body, and `brock release` dispatches it.
- 97496b7: Apps pin Brock once in `package.json#brock.version`, and sync, adopt and create-brock keep every Brock dependency on it. `brock migrate` runs the migrations Brock packages ship, and `<app> upgrade [version] [--check] [--no-review]` moves an app to a release in its own worktree, proves it with the gate and the headless review, and commits when green. Breaking: BrockApp no longer takes logoSrc or instanceLogoSrc (migration brock-app-logo-src), a non-boolean setting row needs a control (migration base-setting-controls), the built-in About menu entry replaces an app's own (migration menu-built-in-about), and .gitignore gains the files newer Brock generates (migration gitignore-generated-files).
